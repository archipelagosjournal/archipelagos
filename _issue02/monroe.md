Frederick Douglass’s account provides a rare window into the everyday
lives of many enslaved Africans in the New World, lives that were
consumed by the grueling demands of plantation labor but were also
filled with everyday domestic realities.[^1] Historical sources are
often silent on such aspects of slave life, and those seeking to tease
out these hidden histories often engage with a variety of source
material. Written accounts, plantation ledgers, slave narratives, oral
traditions, music, folklore, and more are standard “go-to” resources for
uncovering the subtle contours of slave life in the past. In the past
few decades, archaeological evidence has increasingly entered the
conversation, providing a valuable new archive for studying the
materiality of slavery in the past. This evidence sometimes
corroborates, often counters, and always agitates dominant narratives
about slave societies in the New World, and the archaeological study of
slavery has expanded significantly since the first excavations were
undertaken in slave quarters decades ago.

Numerous publications since the 1980s have brought attention to how the
material record of slavery in the New World contributes to our
understanding of food ways, domestic life, economy, and cultural
values.[^2] Yet most archaeological projects focus on a single site or,
rarely, a handful of sites. As the field has matured, scholars have
sought to adopt a comparative approach between sites and across regions,
one that is capable of engaging in broader humanistic discourses on
slave life and culture in the New World. Finding, accessing, and
synthesizing the data necessary for such a comparative approach,
however, is often as complicated as digging an archaeological site
itself. Artifacts, field notes, and final reports are often squirreled
away in either university research labs or, in the best cases, stored in
state or local repositories. Additionally, archaeologists often adopt
idiosyncratic approaches to mapping, excavation, and artifact analysis.
These factors render comparisons between sites a daunting, often
impossible task.

Since 2000, with funding from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the
National Endowment for the Humanities, and the Thomas Jefferson
Foundation, Jillian Galle and Fraser Neiman of the Monticello Department
of Archaeology have led an initiative to rectify this issue. Their
efforts have resulted in the [Digital Archaeological Archive of
Comparative Slavery](https://www.daacs.org/), a relational PostgreSQL
online database designed to synthesize available archaeological datasets
from the Southeast and the Caribbean and to make these data accessible
to the public. As the site creators note, the primary goal of DAACS is
“to foster inter-site, comparative archaeological research that will
advance our historical understanding of the slavery-based societies that
evolved in the Atlantic World during the early-modern era.”[^3] DAACS is
becoming increasingly visible in the archaeological community, driving
change in the way archaeologists think about teaching and researching
slavery in the New World.

DAACS does not just serve as a welcome repository for archaeological
datasets created by others, however; it has achieved the hard work of
standardizing those same datasets using universal descriptors for
artifact types, color data, and stylistic elements, as well as mapping
conventions for site maps. In the seventeen years since the project
began, the DAACS team has studied collections from eighty-one
excavations at thirty-three historic sites, producing a fully query-able
database that immeasurably advances our ability to do comparative
research. Querying the database yields point-and-click access to data on
millions of artifacts, field contexts, objects, and images. The site is
of primary value to archaeologists interested in examining data from key
archaeological sites and to those interested in wrestling with complex
data sets. However, the material presented will also be of serious value
to all scholars and students interested in engaging with archaeological
evidence. Here one can explore reports, artifact images, and site maps
made publicly available, most for the first time, in an accessible
online environment.

The DAACS site is organized hierarchically. The [home
page](https://www.daacs.org/) provides a visually attractive gateway to
the site, with a running list of tabs placed along the top, each linking
to more specific lines of inquiry. Additionally, a number of prominently
displayed features on the home page provide direct links to information
of interest to a general audience. One takes you to the “[About
DAACS](https://www.daacs.org/aboutdaacs/)” page, which provides useful
contextual information about the history and goals of the project as
well as participants and institutional partners. Another directs the
visitor to the “[Galleries](https://www.daacs.org/research/galleries/)”
page (under “Research”), which includes links to a highlights of
artifact assemblages from a subset of sites included in the archive. For
the novice in archaeology, these are excellent starting points. Here one
can find an overview of DAACS history and goals and gain an appreciation
for the range of artifacts recovered from plantation sites, before
digging deeper into the database.

If your interests rest primarily in gaining a broad, qualitative
appreciation for specific sites, the “[Archaeological
Sites](https://www.daacs.org/archaeological-sites-map/)” tab on the home
page will take you to a comprehensive list of excavations included in
DAACS. Clicking on any particular excavation, you will be taken to an
archaeological map of the site, with links to general information about
excavation history and methods, lists of archaeological features, and a
discussion of the chronology of features, as well as a comprehensive set
of photographs and bibliographic references. This information will be
particularly helpful for gaining a general knowledge of a site, locating
references to the archaeological contexts, or just getting a sense of
the features one might use for further comparative analysis.

If you are interested in digging much deeper into the data, the “[Query
the Database](https://www.daacs.org/query-the-database/)” tab on the
home page will take you to a set of “queries” that allow you to extract
specific information about one site, or a group of sites, located in
DAACS. A [context
query](https://www.daacs.org/query-the-database/context-queries/) will
produce information on all of the archaeological contexts and features
excavated in the sites selected. In contrast, an [artifact
query](https://www.daacs.org/query-the-database/artifact-queries/) will
yield finds lists for the site(s) selected, allowing you to quantify
patterns within a site or compare the relative frequencies of different
kinds of artifacts between sites. Such queries, for example, allow you
to determine whether enslaved Africans at one site consumed wild foods
or utilized locally produced cooking pots to a greater degree than those
at another, questions with important implications for our comparative
understanding of the economy and culture of slave sites. Furthermore,
other queries can be run to locate primary documents about sites,
explore site chronology, or retrieve artifact images.

A number of additional features render DAACS an invaluable resource for
both research and teaching. First, under the “[About the
Database](https://www.daacs.org/about-the-database/)” tab are located a
series of manuals and guides for cataloguing artifacts, information on
how the database was structured, and instructions on interpreting and
using DAACS data. Second, under the
“[Research](https://www.daacs.org/research/)” tab, the creators have
provided a comprehensive bibliography of conference presentations,
publications, and theses that have used DAACS data, as well as a
bibliography of source material for the sites presented. Third, the
“[Syllabi and Workshops
Handouts](https://www.daacs.org/research/workshops/)” page (also under
the “Research” tab) contains useful lists of datasets, syllabi, and
teaching modules provided by teaching professionals at DAACS and from
universities across the country. These are mostly geared toward a
university-level audience with some basic skills in quantitative
analysis; however, they could be easily modified to suit a more general
audience.

In all, DAACS has achieved a monumental task, synthesizing and
integrating numerous disparate archaeological data sets into an archive
that is both accessible to the general public and useful for scholarly
research. Although its primary users are archaeologists, innovative and
compelling uses of DAACS data have also come from historians. For
example, historians have used DAACS data to document frequent access to
firearms by enslaved people in North America and have mined DAACS for
evidence of literacy among enslaved populations, in the form of writing
slates and slate pencils.[^4] DAACS also figures importantly in
historians’ reflections on the ways archaeological data might advance
their understanding of changing slave life ways.[^5] Thus open source
data archives like DAACS offer unique opportunities for
interdisciplinary data analysis and dissemination. In DAACS, therefore,
there is much grist for the mill for scholars in a wide range of
disciplines who seek to gain a more holistic account of the nature of
everyday lives of the enslaved in the Southeast and the Caribbean.
