<p>Dedicated to the memory of Kamau Brathwaite, 1930–2020</p>

<p>“All that I have of her is voices”</p>

<p>—Kamau Brathwaite, “Ancestors”</p>

<p>New media technologies enabled Edward Kamau Brathwaite’s revolutionary
poetic approach; digital technologies likewise enable us to study and
teach his groundbreaking work in new ways. I teach Brathwaite’s work at
both undergraduate and graduate levels in a state research university in
New Zealand that attracts students from a diverse demographic and with a
wide range of abilities. I most often introduce Brathwaite’s work in a
second-year course on poetry and music, in which I seek to challenge the
primacy of the written text and the clear-cut distinction between poetry
and music. I find that approaching poetry in this way requires my
students and me to unlearn the traditional focus on the written text in
literary study, but that the pedagogical rewards more than compensate
for this challenge. Students begin my courses with no particular
background in orature. Yet once these digital natives have overcome
their initial prejudices favoring written text, they find that a close
listening approach empowers them to be not just better listeners but
better readers. Such an approach draws on students’ everyday experiences
of orality and recording technologies through downloaded and streamed
popular music. By using these same digital media to listen to
Brathwaite, the students heighten their consciousness of critical facets
of his poetry that are difficult to teach from the page alone. Based on
this experience, I argue here that teaching and studying Brathwaite
should begin with the audible word, not the written text, and that
digital audio archives and platforms can play a key role in enabling
this approach. Digital audio archives allow students and teachers to
approach Brathwaite’s work by listening closely to a wide range of sound
recordings. The digital platform of <em>archipelagos</em> in turn enables me to
demonstrate this close listening approach by allowing me to interweave
my words with Brathwaite’s recorded voice.</p>

<p>A close listening approach to teaching literature challenges critical as
well as pedagogical conventions through a methodological turn away from
the page. The lack of and need for close listening to modern and
contemporary poetry has been recognized in a wide range of work from the
1990s onward.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> The past decade or so has seen a particularly marked
upsurge in new scholarship on poetry performance and recording.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> The
increasing emphasis on the spoken word in the study of poetry is
reflected in and enabled by online platforms such as YouTube, Facebook,
and Twitter, through which many poets in and beyond the Caribbean now
distribute their work. The turn to the recorded word is also marked by
poetry audio–archive projects such as the Poetry Archive and
PennSound.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> Yet despite this increasing attention to and availability
of recordings via the internet, close listening remains a largely
unexplored field and one that is particularly important and valuable in
the classroom context.</p>

<p>Nowhere is close listening more necessary and fruitful than in the case
of Brathwaite. Many have noted the importance of performance to
Brathwaite’s poetics. His celebrated performance of <em>Rights of Passage</em>
at the Jeanetta Cochrane Theatre in London in 1967 was the first public
event of the Caribbean Artists Movement. The performance itself was
proposed by Caribbean Artists Movement cofounder John La Rose after
listening to a tape-recording of Brathwaite reading the work.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup>
Brathwaite himself recalls how his Oxford University Press editor agreed
to the inclusion of the allegedly incomprehensible “Rites” in his 1969
<em>Islands</em> only after he heard the text performed.<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">5</a></sup> Gordon Rohlehr and
Elaine Savory similarly note the impact of Brathwaite’s performances on
listeners.<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote">6</a></sup> There are thus good reasons to believe Brathwaite when he
claims that “if you ignore the noise . . . then you lose part of the
meaning” and advocates “a music literature.”<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote">7</a></sup> Yet approaches to his
work, with the notable exception of brief discussions by Loretta Collins
and Kenneth Sherwood, tend to place the audio text in a subordinate
position to the written.<sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote">8</a></sup> And among all these examples of
scholarship, it is only Sherwood who includes recordings as
accompaniment to the essay; even then, the recordings and essay sit side
by side.<sup id="fnref:9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote">9</a></sup> In contrast, this essay seeks to use the digital medium to
integrate audio clips and analysis and so model the kind of close
listening approach required for both studying and teaching Brathwaite.</p>

<p>A close listening approach enables students to explore Brathwaite’s
intertwining of performance, <em>versioning</em>, sound, music, and vernacular
with his political, historical, and social concerns. First, it upsets
students’ assumptions about the primacy of the written text and
encourages them to treat each recording, live rendition, and equally
variable written text as a performative instantiation of a poetic text
that exists only in and through its multiple performed, recorded, and
written versions. Second, it highlights how this versioning is the
product of Brathwaite’s use of oral and musical forms, from vernacular
language to jazz and calypso, as well as of changes in twentieth- and
twenty-first-century sound recording and of the turn to vernacular and
dialect in modernist poetry. Third, teaching Brathwaite through audio
rather than written text allows students to grasp in a concrete way
Brathwaite’s emphasis on sound and voice as an embodiment of the history
and politics of the Caribbean through the politics of speaking and
listening. It thus also draws attention to the politics of the classroom
situation, which, like Brathwaite’s poetry, requires listening and
response through aural and oral acts of communication.</p>

<h2 id="audio-texts-and-versioning">Audio Texts and Versioning</h2>

<p>Close listening challenges the primacy of the written text and thereby
allows students to grasp the significance of Brathwaite’s poetics of
versioning: his continuous rearrangement and re-presentation of existing
poems in new forms. The term <em>versioning</em> as I use it here is itself
intimately connected to the history of sound recording in the Caribbean.
In the early 1960s, Jamaican producers began to use dub plates
(impermanent acetate discs) in the “process of ‘versioning,’ a method of
serially recycling recorded material developed by producers desiring to
ensure the longest commercial life for a given piece of recorded music
despite economic constraints and a limited pool of musicians.”<sup id="fnref:10" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote">10</a></sup> By
the mid-1960s the DJs who operated the sound systems in Jamaica had
begun to rap, or “toast,” over the music—hence their increasing need for
remixed instrumental, or “dub,” tracks. Emerging from this recording and
performance culture, <em>version</em> became “one of the most important words
in reggae,” in which there are sometimes “literally hundreds of
different versions of the same rhythm or melody.” More broadly
understood, the continuous remixing of existing material in new versions
is arguably “at the heart . . . of <em>all</em> Afro-American and Caribbean
musics.”<sup id="fnref:11" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote">11</a></sup></p>

<p>Scholars have drawn analogies between Caribbean literature and musical
versioning practices. Evelyn O’Callaghan, for instance, reads Caribbean
women’s fiction by analogy with the versioning practice of dub.<sup id="fnref:12" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote">12</a></sup>
However, the connection between Brathwaite’s work and dub versioning is
arguably more direct and even literal. Brathwaite first developed his
versioning practice through sound recordings at the same time—and partly
in the same place—that dub versioning emerged.</p>

<p>Brathwaite first acquired a tape recorder in 1960 while on leave from a
position in Ghana, and he immediately began using it to record a series
of “8 or 9 jazz poems”: “I wrote them . . . a few days after my first
return to Barbados in 1960, returning them into my new reel-to-reel
Philips tape recorder, accompanied on my record player . . . by the
pieces that had inspired the poems.”<sup id="fnref:13" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote">13</a></sup> In these “jazz poems,” six of
which were published in <em>Kyk-Over-Al</em>, Brathwaite combined two audio
reproduction machines—the record player and the tape recorder—to produce
a multitrack version.<sup id="fnref:14" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote">14</a></sup> His tape-based versioning practice
anticipated the dub versioning that was at the time developing in
Jamaica, to where he would relocate in mid-1963, a year after returning
permanently from Ghana to the Caribbean. If “from the global perspective
. . . Jamaica’s emphasis on versioning facilitated the transformation of
formerly fixed pop songs into the more fluid, remix-based conceptions of
composing typified by today’s digital technology,” Brathwaite’s
tape-based versioning practices made a similar contribution to poetry.
Brathwaite used tape to develop a versioning practice that is, like dub
music, “mutable and modular,” in which each poem or series of poems can
be reworked in multiple audio versions.<sup id="fnref:15" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote">15</a></sup></p>

<p>Though not widely recognized, Brathwaite’s use of audio versioning
played a critical role in the composition of his <em>Arrivants</em> trilogy:
<em>Rights of Passage</em>, <em>Islands</em>, and <em>Masks</em>. “I knew right away . . .
that it called for ORAL RESONANCE,” Brathwaite recalls of <em>Rights of
Passage</em>. “I mean I just had to read it out onto tape almost at once and
all the drafts after the first one were influenced by the sound on the
tape.” Tape was, in fact, the poem’s first medium of “publication.”
According to the liner note to a CD version of the <em>The Arrivants</em>, the
first publicly aired recording was made in Jamaica in 1965 “on his reel
to reel ‘with all the natural sounds inside it’—wind, waves, cocks
crowing, dogs barking, cars passing, people walking, talking.”<sup id="fnref:16" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote">16</a></sup>
Brathwaite’s account reveals the value he places on each recording—be it
mixed with music or ambient noise—as a unique version of his poetic
work.</p>

<p>Listening to recordings of Brathwaite not only reveals the importance of
audio recording to his versioning practice but also highlights the
importance of the various audio media through which his work has been
recorded and the possibilities and challenges of approaching such audio
work through the digital archive. Between the 1950s and his death in
early 2020, Brathwaite produced audio versions across a variety of media
and formats. These versions include his recorded broadcasts for the BBC
program <em>Caribbean Voices</em> in the 1950s; the recordings made on a
portable transistor reel-to-reel tape recorder in the early to
mid-1960s; the recordings made on a large Akai reel-to-reel machine for
the Caribbean Artists Movement in London in the late 1960s; the LP
versions of his <em>Arrivants</em> trilogy released in the late 1960s and early
1970s; the cassette tape recordings of his readings and lectures from
the 1970s through the 1990s; and the digital recordings across various
formats made over the last two to three decades.</p>

<p>Today it is much easier to teach Brathwaite through close listening
thanks to the distribution of multiple recordings of his work online
through sites such as PennSound. Digital archives enhance the ability of
teachers to present Brathwaite’s recordings in class and of students to
access those files outside class. At the same time, these digital audio
files threaten to diminish our attention to the different media on which
these performances were recorded. It matters, for instance, that
Brathwaite first made extensive use of homemade audio recordings through
the medium of reel-to-reel tape. It also matters that listeners
approaching the LP versions of <em>The Arrivants</em> would encounter the
albums framed by a series of liner notes and artwork. And for <em>The
Arrivants</em> in particular, the tape-recorded and LP versions also shaped
the structure of the texts, which were, for instance, punctuated in the
LP versions by the division into A and B sides. In contrast, the 2004
New York City Segue reading sampled in this essay is born digital. Such
differences tend to be obscured when students encounter a series of
downloadable MP3 files. However, it is precisely for this reason that
teaching Brathwaite through close listening is also an opportunity to
have students reflect on the specificity of these media and how we
encounter them differently when we approach them through online digital
archives or through this online multimedia essay. Close listening to
Brathwaite should prompt us to consider the incompleteness and
contingencies of the archival record of sound recording. What is
currently available online, for instance, is only a fraction of the
extant audio record associated with Brathwaite. Moreover, many
predigital recordings, such as the 1965 tape-recording of <em>Rights of
Passage</em> that Brathwaite’s cites as the poem’s first form of
publication, have likely been lost forever.<sup id="fnref:17" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote">17</a></sup> Brathwaite’s archive in
Jamaica destroyed by Hurricane Gilbert in 1988 reportedly contained many
unique audio recordings. Close listening to Brathwaite enables a larger
reflection on the nature of digital audio archives: what they can tell
us and what they leave unsaid.</p>

<p>Grasping versioning through close listening also provides a way into
Brathwaite’s use of oral and musical traditions. Brathwaite’s use of
music has been extensively documented and analyzed by Gordon Rohlehr,
Loretta Collins, Lilieth Nelson, Donette Francis, and others. One way to
develop a sense of close listening attuned to musicality is for students
to listen to the sources Rohlehr identifies alongside the poems.<sup id="fnref:18" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote">18</a></sup>
The effectiveness of this approach is, however, greatly enhanced by
listening to Brathwaite’s texts in recorded performances. These
performances often verge on song, underscoring the connections Rohlehr
identifies and adding a layer that is not present in the written text.
Examples of the shift to song are plentiful in Brathwaite performance
and include “Negus,”[1 Negus Segue 2004 conclusion sung.mp3] “The
Twist,”[2 The Twist Segue 2004.mp3] “Atumpan,”[3 Atumpan.mp3]
“Caliban,”[4 Caliban Segue 2004 limbo sung clip.mp3] and “Soweto”[5
from Soweto.mp3]; also present are instances of drum-like repetition,
as in “Nights,”[5b KB Nights from cross cult poetics Namsetoura.mp3]
“Shepherd,”[6 shepherd extract.mp3] “Wings of a Dove,”[7 Wings of a
Dove down down extract.mp3] and “Angel/Engine.”[8 angel engine
extract.mp3]<sup id="fnref:19" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote">19</a></sup> Through close listening to such recordings, students
interrogate the intertwining of Brathwaite’s work with oral and musical
traditions that themselves produce many versions, as in multiple
performances or recordings of the same song.</p>

<p>A close listening approach does not imply that the written text is
unimportant but allows students to recognize that each audio text
constitutes a version as significant as any written version. The notion
of versioning in Brathwaite’s work (related to the broader notion of
“othering” that Nathaniel Mackey applies to Brathwaite’s poetry) is
often addressed in criticism and teaching through Brathwaite’s reworking
of earlier poems and cycles in books such as his 1992 <em>Middle Passages</em>
and 2001 <em>Ancestors</em> and through his Sycorax video-style: the graphic
textual versioning practice that he developed on his Apple Mac computer
in the 1980s.<sup id="fnref:20" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote">20</a></sup> Yet many of Brathwaite’s versions, such as, for
example, the 1994 <em>Barabajan Poems: 1492–1992</em>, started life in a
recorded oral performance, and, consequently, his poetics of versioning
is equally approachable through close listening to recorded audio
texts.<sup id="fnref:21" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote">21</a></sup></p>

<p>Through close listening, students encounter rich examples of
Brathwaite’s versioning and rearrangement of poems. “The Rwanda Poems,”
for instance, exists, in a published version under that name, only as an
audio recording of a 1994 performance, although the closely related
cycle “Rwanda” appears in print as part 3 of “New Gods of the Middle
Passages” in Brathwaite’s 2001 <em>Kamau Monograph</em>.<sup id="fnref:22" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote">22</a></sup> In the “New Gods”
version, however, not all “The Rwanda Poems” falls into the “Rwanda”
section, and the poems are reordered and arranged alongside additional
poems and other print material. The performed cycle “The Rwanda Poems”
is itself an amalgam of poems from <em>The Arrivants</em>, including “Negus”
and part of “Caliban,” and newer work, again reflecting Brathwaite’s
practice of refashioning his existing material. In the recording of
“Rwanda Poems,” Brathwaite explains how his versioning practice includes
both his Sycorax video-style and his performances. He describes how the
poems “are layered or interfaced with some earlier material . . . to
create another effect from that earlier material.”[9 KB Rwanda Poems
intro.mp3]<sup id="fnref:23" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote">23</a></sup> Similarly, in many other readings, Brathwaite presents
newer material alongside poems from <em>The Arrivants</em>, structuring this
combination into a narrative of personal biography or a framework for
thinking about Caribbean history in the present.<sup id="fnref:24" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote">24</a></sup> Likewise, in his
2004 Segue performance at the Bowery Poetry Club in New York City,
Brathwaite creates an alternative and integrated cycle deriving mainly
from <em>The Arrivants</em>. He follows the final line of “Atumpan,” “may we
succeed,” with the opening lines of “Naming,” “How then shall we /
succeed?”[10 KB Atumpan to Naming segue in Segue reading.mp3]<sup id="fnref:25" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote">25</a></sup> He
thus seamlessly links two poems separated by more than one hundred pages
in the print version of his trilogy.</p>

<p>Close listening overcomes the bewilderment that some students––and
likewise scribal poets and critics—experience at Brathwaite’s recycling
of poetic material. As Savory points out, Brathwaite’s versioning
practice contradicts “Western traditions of creativity since the
Renaissance” that “have elevated originality.” At stake here is an idea
of creativity as “process, and performance, and revisioning,” arguably
more akin to “many African, oral cultures.”<sup id="fnref:26" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote">26</a></sup> Close listening conveys
such a conception of creativity to students by placing each printed and
written poetic version in the familiar context of repeated concert
performances, recordings, or remixes of a single song or piece of music.</p>

<p>I encourage students to think about Brathwaite’s versioning techniques
by asking them to listen closely to his performances and then to compare
them to the written text. Encouraging students to listen for differences
heightens their attention to the text (audio and written), to word
changes, and to the relationship between page and stage. Students hear
how Brathwaite frequently extends or modifies repetitions and introduces
new sung or nonverbal elements, especially drumming. For example,
students can hear poems such as “The Twist” in quite different versions
in his 2004 Segue and 1988 Pittsburgh International Poetry Forum
performances. In each case, it is not only that the words are different
and the drumming accompaniment varies but that each version places the
poem in a radically different context. Equally, they find that
Brathwaite sometimes cuts sections from poems in performance, as in his
Griffin Poetry Prize performance of “Kumina.”<sup id="fnref:27" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote">27</a></sup> At other times he
runs one poem into another, as in the combining of “Xângo at the Summer
Solstice” and “The Twist” in his Segue reading.[11 KB Xango to the
Twist Segue reading.mp3]<sup id="fnref:28" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote">28</a></sup> They also note that Brathwaite frequently
interrupts his poems to comment on them.<sup id="fnref:29" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote">29</a></sup> Close listening to all
these variations provides the basis for a discussion of the text
informed by an awareness of its constitutive multiplicity.</p>

<p>Brathwaite’s poetics of versioning can be related to what he calls
“montage” and “calibanisms.” To illustrate the role of montage, I have
students listen to Brathwaite performing “The Emigrants”[12 KB
Emigrants montage IPF 1987.mp3] in his 1987 International Poetry Forum
performance.<sup id="fnref:30" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote">30</a></sup> In this performance, Brathwaite interrupts the poem to
say that this is the first time he used the technique of montage in his
poetry, referring to how the poem superimposes the experience of
Caribbean migrants traveling to Britain after the Second World War on
Christopher Columbus’s voyage to the Americas. I point out to my
students that Brathwaite’s own interjection about montage itself
constitutes another layer in the montage and that more generally the
interplay between the many versions of his poems in his books and in his
recordings functions in this montage-like, juxtaposing, multilayered
way.</p>

<p>In addition to drawing a parallel between Brathwaite’s montage
techniques and his versioning of his poems, I also note how these
versions are larger-scale instances of his frequent reiterations of
words. These word repetitions—or “insistences,” in Gertrude Stein’s
sense—appear frequently in Brathwaite’s punning, paronomastic
poetry.<sup id="fnref:31" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote">31</a></sup> For example, Brathwaite links “semicolons” and
“semicolonies” in “Negus,” and “canon” and “cannon”[13 KB canon as
cannon IPF 1987.mp3] in speaking about the difficulties of escaping the
tyranny of English literature in his 1987 International Poetry Forum
talk and poetry reading.<sup id="fnref:32" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote">32</a></sup> Close listening to “Negus” demonstrates
the relationship between word repetition and the repetition of entire
poems in Brathwaite’s performance poetics. In the style of a preacher,
Brathwaite builds “Negus” around the repeated word “it” and the phrases
“it is not” and “it is not enough.”[14 KB it it from Negus
Segue.mp3]<sup id="fnref:33" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote">33</a></sup> This word repetition parallels the repetition of the
poem itself in various performances, in which it is frequently used by
Brathwaite as an introductory piece.<sup id="fnref:34" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote">34</a></sup> Just as the word “it” builds
up a mesmeric power as it is repeated haltingly in Brathwaite’s
performance, each repetition of “Negus” allows the poem to accumulate
new resonances. By close listening to such variations in the selection,
ordering, and instantiation of his poems, students recognize how the
repetition and variation of set elements from the single word to the
poem become critical structural devices in Brathwaite’s poetics.</p>

<h2 id="oral-and-musical-forms">Oral and Musical Forms</h2>

<p>When students recognize that Brathwaite’s poetry exists in multiple
versions with no one definitive text, they apprehend a feature that ties
his work—and his audio texts in particular—to oral folk traditions and
popular music. A simple but critical example of the importance of
musicality and sound to Brathwaite’s poetics comes from “Calypso” in
<em>The Arrivants</em>, which Brathwaite uses in <em>History of the Voice</em> to
exemplify the need to break out of the iambic pentameter and English
literary tradition.<sup id="fnref:35" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote">35</a></sup> In reading the print version of Brathwaite’s
<em>History of the Voice</em>, however, we encounter precisely the problem with
approaching his work through the written text. In the essay Brathwaite
explains how, when read aloud, the poem’s calypso rhythm works “to break
down the pentameter.”<sup id="fnref:36" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote">36</a></sup> And yet without the benefit of hearing
Brathwaite perform these lines we have to take it on trust that the poem
overturns rather than evokes the pentameter beat.</p>

<p>Listening to Brathwaite discuss the poem “Calypso” in his 1987
International Poetry Forum performance, however, provides a vivid
illustration for students of how the poem resists conventional English
prosody, an illustration that directly challenges the primacy of the
written text and, simultaneously, underscores the importance of oral and
musical traditions. In his recorded discussion of “Calypso,”[15 KB IPF
1987 Calypso.mp3] Brathwaite performs the distinction between poetry on
the page and in performance as the difference between a conventional
English poetic reading and an almost sung version using the timed rhythm
of the calypso beat.<sup id="fnref:37" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote">37</a></sup> Brathwaite reads the opening lines twice. His
first reading demonstrates how, “on the page,” the poem has “almost the
hint of the dreaded pentameter.” He goes on to explain, however, that
the poem should be read with attention to the <em>kaiso</em> rhythm signaled by
the title. In his second reading of the poem, Brathwaite demonstrates
his point by performing the opening lines accompanied by his own
drumming and in the musical or timed rhythm of a calypso.<sup id="fnref:38" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote">38</a></sup> The
difference between spoken and musically timed speech evident in the
recording unsettles the stress patterns of standard English in a way
that recalls the distinctive stress given to the final syllables of some
words in Caribbean English. I point out to students that the deviations
from expected stress patterns and traditional English meters parallel
the way Western music fails to “differentiate between the many patterns
of accent that are possible in a musical period,” a failure that led
early European listeners to falsely conclude that there was no concept
of musical period in African music.<sup id="fnref:39" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote">39</a></sup> Brathwaite’s performance also
dramatizes a debate within anglophone Caribbean poetry about the
relationship between European prosody and Afro-Caribbean rhythm. His
recorded performance of “Calypso” implicitly opposes Derek Walcott’s
assertion, made in a 1977 interview, that “Calypso is pentametric in
composition.”<sup id="fnref:40" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote">40</a></sup> The recording not only demonstrates to students the
limits of reading the text on the page but also highlights the capacity
of Brathwaite’s use of voice and music to dramatize battles over
language and poetic and musical traditions.</p>

<p>Other performances in which Brathwaite moves into song also highlight
his adaptation—or versioning—of musical forms. I have students listen to
examples such as “Ancestors,” which ends in the “blues” “Sookey
dead-o,”[16 KB IPF 1987 Ancestors extract.mp3] and the concluding
“<em>bongo man a come</em> / <strong>bruggadung</strong>”[17 KB Bongo man song from Soweto
reading.mp3] of “Soweto.”<sup id="fnref:41" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote">41</a></sup> Such instances of song provide a context
too for the more clearly communal and spiritual music-making invoked and
performed in “Angel/Engine.”<sup id="fnref:42" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote">42</a></sup> These moments of song are also the
places where Brathwaite will most often deviate from his published
written versions, especially by varying the number of repetitions or
sometimes even skipping whole sections or adding new lines.<sup id="fnref:43" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote">43</a></sup> These
variations highlight the context of live performance, Brathwaite’s
consciousness of the need to entertain, and the powerful grip that these
musical moments have on his audience (they are the most likely to be
followed by applause in live performances).</p>

<p>Close listening also reveals how Brathwaite’s use of dialect and music
appeals to and builds on a modernist legacy of vernacular speech,
popular music, and improvisation. The use of vernacular, or what
Brathwaite calls “nation language,” can be heard and appreciated in
poems such as “The Dust” and “Rites,” which students find much more
readily comprehensible in recorded performance than on the page.<sup id="fnref:44" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote">44</a></sup>
For some scholars, Brathwaite’s use of vernacular and popular music
echoes T. S. Eliot’s “revolutionary voice of early modernism, a voice
that challenges Standard English poetry with new types of speech and
forms of popular culture.”<sup id="fnref:45" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote">45</a></sup> What most scholars miss, however, is the
literalness of Brathwaite’s “listening to Eliot.”<sup id="fnref:46" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote">46</a></sup> I play recordings
of Eliot to my students, noting how Brathwaite cites hearing “Eliot’s
actual voice––or rather his recorded voice . . . ––not the texts” as
being influential on his development.<sup id="fnref:47" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote">47</a></sup></p>

<p>Audio technologies play a key role in Brathwaite’s poetics and in his
own formative listening to recordings of Eliot and others. I find
students become more conscious of the role of audio technologies when
they connect Brathwaite’s recording and sampling poetics to their own
use of digital audio files. I ask students to compare Brathwaite’s
practice to their own construction of a personal canon through audio
collections and playlists. Using Brathwaite’s example, my students have
created their own playlists of poems and music in response to
Brathwaite’s poetry.<sup id="fnref:48" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote">48</a></sup></p>

<p>Brathwaite has long used audio technologies, drawing on his personal
recordings and playlists of poetry and music in his own poetic
compositions and in his talks and writing about poetry. The latter is
exemplified by his essay <em>History of the Voice</em>, which includes an
extensive discography. Subtitled “An Electronic Lecture” when it first
appeared in print, the essay started life as a talk that involved the
interplay of Brathwaite’s live voice and a variety of poetic and musical
recordings complied on a mixtape. Brathwaite emphasizes the importance
of the recorded word and what a reading of the published essay misses:
“I have to have a tape recorder for this presentation.”<sup id="fnref:49" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote">49</a></sup> Here
Brathwaite also highlights the fact that the published essay is itself
an edited transcription of a recording of a live performance of the
lecture.<sup id="fnref:50" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote">50</a></sup></p>

<p>Through a close listening approach, Brathwaite’s turn to the technology
of the computer can be seen in the light of his earlier use of audio
technologies. Close listening to Brathwaite helps reveal the multiple
ways his use of oral, folk, and musical traditions (and these traditions
themselves) engage twentieth- and twenty-first-century technologies,
from radio to the computer.<sup id="fnref:51" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote">51</a></sup> Recognizing Brathwaite’s indebtedness
to audio technologies unsettles the contention that his use of the new
technology of the computer contradicts his earlier emphasis on folk,
oral, and musical forms.<sup id="fnref:52" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:52" class="footnote">52</a></sup> A close listening approach to Brathwaite
underscores how his use of popular music and popular music itself arise
out of innovations in recording and transmission technologies—including
the World Wide Web through which his recordings are available for
teaching and study today.</p>

<h2 id="politics-and-performance">Politics and Performance</h2>

<p>Through close listening, students also become attuned to the political
and social significance of Brathwaite’s recorded performances, which
address an audience and demand a response. The pedagogical challenge
here is to assist students in relating their relatively straightforward
descriptive analysis of Brathwaite’s performances to the complex
relationship between performed word, performer, and audience. These
issues are, of course, also at stake on the page, but the context of
performance, particularly recordings of live performance, prompts
students to question the nature and political significance of the
relationship between listener and speaker.</p>

<p>I illustrate to students the political significance of Brathwaite’s
performances through close listening to his use of the limbo. In his
<em>Middle Passages</em> lecture, he uses the limbo refrain to challenge the
audience: “Limbo is a psychophysical ritual that awaits us. . . . We all
got to get under in order to get over.”[18 KB on the limbo Middle
Passages lecture.mp3]<sup id="fnref:53" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote">53</a></sup> Here the popular dance becomes a figure for
the Middle Passage, just as it does in his poem “Caliban” from
<em>Islands</em>, the third part of Brathwaite’s <em>Arrivants</em> trilogy.
Brathwaite even interrupts his 2004 Segue recording of “Caliban” to
underscore the symbolic significance of the limbo[19 KB Limbo
Segue.mp3], thus offering another version of the poem that by directly
addressing the audience draws the listener in.<sup id="fnref:54" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:54" class="footnote">54</a></sup> Similarly, in the
<em>Middle Passages</em> performance, Brathwaite uses the limbo to address the
audience directly and demand a response.<sup id="fnref:55" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:55" class="footnote">55</a></sup> The performance thus draws
attention to the embodied situation of listener and performer through
the embodied process of the limbo dance. In this way Brathwaite produces
a poetic practice that demands response—sounding, listening, and being
heard, not being “mum,”[20 KB on mum Middle Passages lecture
reading.mp3] silent, or “dumb.”[6 shepherd extract.mp3]<sup id="fnref:56" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:56" class="footnote">56</a></sup></p>

<p>Brathwaite’s challenge suggests the political importance of close
listening—of an approach to teaching that refuses the “mum” of silent
close reading in favor of the sound of the recorded word. “Reading is an
isolated, individualistic expression,” Brathwaite argues. “The oral
tradition on the other hand makes demands not only on the griot but the
audience to complete the community. The noise and sounds that the maker
makes are responded to by the audience and are returned to him.”<sup id="fnref:57" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:57" class="footnote">57</a></sup>
Listening to Brathwaite perform and discuss the limbo allows students to
recognize the dance as a central figure for the embodied act of
performing and listening—for Brathwaite’s “Caribbean-centered vision of
the complex conversation between self and community.”<sup id="fnref:58" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:58" class="footnote">58</a></sup>
Simultaneously, it allows them to grasp how the dancer’s bent body
registers the paradoxical situation whereby reliving the Middle Passage
becomes a source of strength.</p>

<p>Close listening enables students to hear such unexpected shifts and
paradoxes in Brathwaite’s performances. In particular, students become
aware of how performance complicates Brathwaite’s claim of producing an
authentic, “total Caribbean experience.”[21 KB total experience IPF
1987.mp3]<sup id="fnref:59" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote">59</a></sup> Listening, we do not know where the poem is leading, and
so we must pay attention to the twists and turns of performance.
Brathwaite emphasizes this uncertainty at the start of his performances
by, for example, claiming, “I’m going to try something that I have never
tried before,” or “I can’t be certain about anything—I might not even be
able to read at all.”<sup id="fnref:60" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:60" class="footnote">60</a></sup> Each performance is something new; thus
authenticity in his poetry is not something essential but continuously
in flux.</p>

<p>In his 2004 Segue reading in New York City, Brathwaite provides just
such an unexpected twist by improvising a new version of the poem “The
Twist” at the conclusion of his performance. In this new version
Brathwaite returns to the poem that he had performed earlier in the
reading, but this time, to conclude his performance, he dramatically
alters the final verse, presenting the poem as a self-referential
comment on his appearance on stage “on a night like this,”[22 KB Twist
reprise Segue.mp3] the poem’s final line.<sup id="fnref:61" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:61" class="footnote">61</a></sup> In his 1988
International Poetry Forum performance, however, Brathwaite locates the
poem in the context of the aborted US Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba and
his own return to the Caribbean, to a situation of neocolonial
entrapment: “The go-go girls . . . are still trapped in this eternal
treadmill, . . . the ghetto becoming a necklace, . . . not of beauty but
of a kind of neoslavery.”[23 KB Twist comment IPF 1988.mp3]<sup id="fnref:62" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:62" class="footnote">62</a></sup> The
apparent hopelessness of this latter context contrasts with the perhaps
more hopeful lines in the Segue reprise: “Feel the hunger, feel the
passion pull upon your strings, watch her, twist her, love her on a
night like this.” Together the two contexts also highlight the
problematic position of the poet as performer embodying a situation that
might be, as he describes the English language, both “a model and a
prison.”[24 KB IPF 1987 model and prison.mp3]<sup id="fnref:63" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:63" class="footnote">63</a></sup> That is, on the one
hand, performance offers up the possibility of a genuine communal
situation and so of “love.” But on the other, performance presents a
potentially exploitative situation, one that parallels both the
prostitution of the “shanty town . . . girls,” and also the manipulation
of the audience by the poet, who, like the dancer, pulls “upon your
strings.”</p>

<p>“The Twist,” then, highlights how slavery has been exchanged for the
neocolonial sex slavery of prostitution fed by US tourism and by the US
Marines to whose colonial presence in the region Brathwaite refers in
introducing the poem in his 1988 International Poetry Forum performance.
But hearing the poem also links this situation to the act of performance
itself by implicating the listener and the poet in this situation of
voyeurism and exploitation. The attractiveness of the song as performed
by Brathwaite belies its depiction of suffering and so parallels the
attractiveness of the dancers, which hides their desperation. In his
2004 Segue reading in New York, Brathwaite presents the limbo as both a
form of nightclub entertainment and a reenactment of the cruel,
back-breaking suffering and labor of the Middle Passage and slavery.
Similarly, in the same New York performance, Brathwaite performs “The
Twist” to focus attention on the cruel suffering underlying the smiling
face of entertainment for the tourist and, by implication, for the
literary armchair traveler to exotic locations.</p>

<p>Yet, as I note to my students, the relationship between performance,
exploitation, and emancipation is even more critical and complex in “The
Twist” and in Brathwaite’s poetry generally. After all, Brathwaite, in
“Jazz and the West Indian Novel,” responds to Walcott’s assertion that
“we must teach our philosophy to reach above the navel” by arguing, “It
is around this very navel that the battle ranges. The alternative
tradition is belly-centred: in the beat, in the drum, the apparent
bawdy”; it is “belly-drum centred.”<sup id="fnref:64" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:64" class="footnote">64</a></sup> Similarly, in “Calypso”
Brathwaite appeals to the calypso as the locus of a “total Caribbean
experience,” even as the poem acknowledges that this appeal seems to
reinforce what Rohlehr terms the “new minstrel stereotype” of the
mid-twentieth-century “image of the Trinidadian as a happy-go-lucky
calypso-singing masquerader.”<sup id="fnref:65" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:65" class="footnote">65</a></sup> Listening to the Segue recording,
students hear Brathwaite pose the question “How can we succeed?” They
also hear him identify an answer to that question in the “belly-drum
centred” tradition developed throughout the reading, from the “it / it /
it” of “Negus”[14 KB it it from Negus Segue.mp3] through the “Kon kon
kon kon / kun kun kun kun” of “Atumpan”[3 Atumpan.mp3] and the “dumb /
dumb / dumb” of “Shepherd”[6 shepherd extract.mp3] to the
revolutionary “beat dem drums / dem” drumbeat of “Wings of a Dove.”[25
KB beat dem Wings of a Dove Segue.mp3]<sup id="fnref:66" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:66" class="footnote">66</a></sup> The passage of this
drumbeat recalls Brathwaite’s account of the dancer of the limbo as a
symbolic reenactment of the Middle Passage. The drumbeat allows the
voice to emerge from its very dumbness—out of the nadar, nothingness,
and silence of the literal and metaphorical Middle Passage—into the
“kingdom of the word,”[26 KB Negus Segue kingdom of word.mp3] a word
that Brathwaite extends into a long wavering note in his Segue
performance of “Negus.”<sup id="fnref:67" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:67" class="footnote">67</a></sup> Close listening to “The Twist” thus
underscores the interplay between exploitation and emancipation in
Brathwaite’s poetics through the poem’s affirmation of rhythm and music
emerging from injustice and suffering and through the way this tension
revolves around the poet’s act of performance. The turns of meaning in
“The Twist” make the poem a figure for Brathwaite’s performative
poetics, most powerfully and unsettlingly evident and teachable through
close listening to the digital archive of his recordings.</p>

<p>Many of the critical relationships––between versions on the page and in
performance, between oral traditions and audio-recording technologies,
between the performer and the performance––that one can explore in
Brathwaite’s work through a close listening approach are equally
important to classroom teaching. A final reason for close listening to
Brathwaite is that it makes us, as teachers, address the demands that
the classroom places on our students and ourselves to be close listeners
and performers, aware of all the twists and turns that our shared acts
of speaking and listening might bring.</p>

Walcott’s comment came a year after Brathwaite presented the first
version of his “History of the Voice” lecture at the 1976 Carifesta
in Jamaica. In the lecture, Brathwaite discusses how Walcott’s
poetry deploys Caribbean language and idiom (what Brathwaite calls
“nation language”), but he also identifies a colonial residue in
Walcott’s commitment to the pentameter. <a href="#fnref:40" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
