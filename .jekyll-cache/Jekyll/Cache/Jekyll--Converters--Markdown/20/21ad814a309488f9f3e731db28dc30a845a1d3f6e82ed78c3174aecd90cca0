I"_ğ<p>Over the past few decades, the colonial Caribbean has served as a site
of robust digital work. Most well known is <a href="https://www.slavevoyages.org/"><em>Voyages: The Trans-Atlantic
Slave Trade Database</em></a>, which contains information about thirty-six
thousand slaving voyages from the sixteenth through the nineteenth
centuries. There are numerous others, however, including <a href="https://ecda.northeastern.edu/"><em>The Early
Caribbean Digital Archive</em></a>, the goal of which is to assemble a
similarly wide-ranging collection of texts about the colonial Caribbean.
Other projects focus on more localized historical events and spaces,
including <a href="http://revolt.axismaps.com/"><em>Slave Revolt in Jamaica, 1760â€“1761</em></a> and <a href="https://historydesignstudio.com/projects/two-plantations-enslaved-families-in-virginia-and-jamaica"><em>Two Plantations</em></a>. Finally, projects like <a href="http://www.musicalpassage.org/"><em>Musical Passage: A Voyage to 1688 Jamaica</em></a> excavate the deep histories of single pages within texts
in an attempt to recover information about the lives of enslaved and
other marginalized subjects.<sup id="fnref:f1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:f1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> As diverse as these projects have
been in form and content, they are united by their desire to use digital
technologies to question, challenge, and mediate the archives of empire
and slavery that serve as their sites of analysis.</p>

<p><a href="https://digital-grainger.github.io/grainger/"><em>Digital Grainger: An Online Edition of â€œThe Sugar-Caneâ€ (1764)</em></a> is
one of the latest projects in this line of critical digital humanities
work on the colonial Caribbean. <em>Digital Grainger</em> takes as its
primary object James Graingerâ€™s 1764 <em>The Sugar-Cane</em>, an
approximately twenty-five-hundred-line poem that describes the workings
of the eighteenth-century Caribbean sugar plantation. Created by a team
of scholars from Columbia and Fordham Universities, including Julie Chun
Kim, Cristobal Silva, Alex Gil, Kimberly Takahata, Ami Yoon, Steve
Fragano, Lina Jiang, and Elizabeth Cornell, <em>Digital Grainger</em>
provides an open and accessible version of the poem for undergraduate
and graduate teaching. As a digital edition of a text increasingly
taught in courses about the early Caribbean and the early Americas, the
project prompts students and other readers to grapple with how to read a
text that explicitly advocates for the continuation of the plantation
system. In particular, the edition seeks to guide readers both to
realize this textâ€™s complicity in colonialism and slavery and to ask the
questions, What can <em>The Sugar-Cane</em> reveal to us not only about
colonial ideologies but also about the histories and lives of the
enslaved and other marginalized subjects who sustained the
eighteenth-century economy of sugar? Are there ways to read a colonial
text so that one does not simply accept or replicate its biases or even
our own expectations as we develop interpretations and analyses?</p>

<p>Critical work over approximately the last fifteen years has laid the
ground for asking such questions about <em>The Sugar-Cane</em>. Read by Jim
Egan in 2003 as a testament to colonial anxieties about sustaining
British identity in a distant, tropical environment, the poem also has
been interpreted as expressing Graingerâ€™s doubts about his ability to
maintain control over the tropical landscapes and sugar plantations he
describes as well as over the enslaved persons who labored on
them.<sup id="fnref:f2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:f2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> Moreover, while some studies have shown how Grainger
sought to shore up his authority through scientific and medical
footnotes, others have begun to challenge that authority by identifying
the enslaved and indigenous sources of information and expertise that
would have provided Grainger with much of his understanding of
plantation ecologies.<sup id="fnref:f3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:f3" class="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>Building on these conversations, <em>Digital Grainger</em> uses the space of
the digital to open editorial possibilities not afforded by print media
to draw out these networks and practices. As a result, this project
serves as one manifestation of what Roopika Risam terms â€œpostcolonial
digital humanities,â€ which seeks to use new tools and methods to
â€œintervene in colonial and neocolonial dimensions of the digital
cultural recordâ€ with the goal of â€œ[creating] space for
underrepresented communities to populate the digital cultural record
with their own stories.â€<sup id="fnref:f4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:f4" class="footnote">4</a></sup> Our primary strategy involves creating
what we call a â€œcounter-editionâ€ containing multiple versions of the
poem. Rather than simply replicating Graingerâ€™s poem and thereby
allowing his voice to remain unchallenged, we instead seek to surround
and undermine Graingerâ€™s status as a singular author by calling
attention to the other authorities that he relied on to construct his
poem. We also present readers with multiple reading experiences,
including excerpts that constitute what we call â€œThe Counter-Plantationâ€
section of our edition. By excerpting <em>The Sugar-Cane</em>, we encourage
our readers to see the poem as a work that can be manipulated and even
broken apart to reveal stories other than the ones Grainger wanted to
tell. Ultimately, as we conclude, these interventions reveal the
indigenous and Afro-Caribbean networks of knowledge that undergird <em>The
Sugar-Cane</em>, and our edition therefore works to challenge Graingerâ€™s
goal of imposing order on the plantation and his own authority over
readers. Nevertheless, even with these interventions, the complexities
of <em>The Sugar-Cane</em> and other colonial texts, which actively worked to
elide and suppress the contributions of marginalized agents and
individuals, means that further creative digital work is needed to
recover their lives and experiences.</p>

<h2 id="the-sugar-canes-multiple-authorities"><em>The Sugar-Cane</em>â€™s Multiple Authorities</h2>

<p>James Grainger, the author of <em>The Sugar-Cane</em>, was born in the
mid-1720s in Duns, Scotland. Shortly after he was orphaned at the age of
ten, he was apprenticed to an Edinburgh surgeon and eventually enrolled
at the University of Edinburgh to study medicine. He served in the
Jacobite Rising of 1745 and the War of Austrian Succession (1740â€“48) as
a regimental surgeon and afterward moved to London to practice medicine.
Even though Grainger was a doctor, his true passion, arguably, was
literature, and he had ambitions of becoming a well-known and respected
poet. His move to London therefore coincided with his formation of
connections with such prominent authors as Samuel Johnson, Bishop Thomas
Percy, Oliver Goldsmith, William Shenstone, and Charlotte Lennox. During
this period, Grainger succeeded in publishing several short poems,
reviews, and translations of Tibullusâ€™s elegies.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Grainger could not support himself financially with his
writing and traveled to the Caribbean in 1759 under the patronage of
former pupil John Bourryau. Grainger embarked on a sea voyage to St.
Kitts, where Bourryau had recently inherited a sugar estate. Grainger
soon found himself with an even more direct connection to sugar
plantations, however: during his Atlantic voyage, Grainger treated a
woman infected with smallpox. He also met her daughter, Daniel Matthew
Burt, whom he married soon after arriving in St. Kitts. Although Burt
came from a family of wealthy planters, Grainger himself did not have
the means to immediately establish his own plantation. Still, he
concluded his patronage and became a plantation physician with the hopes
of eventually becoming a planter himself.</p>

<p>Even as his situation changed, Grainger maintained the literary
ambitions he entertained while living in London. As a result, he wrote
an early draft of <em>The Sugar-Cane</em> while in St. Kitts, sending a
manuscript back to England in 1762 for Percyâ€™s review. The first edition
of <em>The Sugar-Cane</em> was then published in London in 1764, with two
more editions published in London and Dublin in 1766. There were also
excerpts of <em>The Sugar-Cane</em> published in numerous magazines and
anthologies. Graingerâ€™s poem is a self-proclaimed â€œWest-India georgicâ€;
that is, it is a georgic poem set in and written about the West
Indies.<sup id="fnref:f5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:f5" class="footnote">5</a></sup> Modeled after Virgilâ€™s <em>Georgics</em>, eighteenth-century
neogeorgic poems like Graingerâ€™s followed traditional georgics in their
use of four books to instruct readers in the arts of agriculture and to
praise the effects of agricultural labor on society. Graingerâ€™s decision
to characterize his work this way makes a decisive statement about his
ambitions: he wanted to establish himself as a writer fit to follow in
the footsteps of Virgil, and he sought to demonstrate the integral role
the Caribbean colonies and their agricultural economy played in
sustaining the British Empire.<sup id="fnref:f6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:f6" class="footnote">6</a></sup> Yet in order to enact such goals,
Grainger had to balance the aesthetic demands of the genre with the
physical reality of the plantation system. In other words, by looking to
refashion the Caribbean in a European image, he sought to transplant the
georgic onto a locale and political and economic system for which it was
not originally designed. This tension is visible throughout the poem,
such as in a moment when he describes an aspect of sugar harvesting as
comparable to the shearing of sheep:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>SOME bending, of their sapless burden ease<br />
The yellow jointed canes, (whose height exceeds<br />
A mounted trooper, and whose clammy round<br />
Measures two inches full;) and near the root<br />
Lop the stem off, which quivers in their hand<br />
With fond impatienceâ€¦<br />
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â â€¦What of the Cane<br />
Remains, and much the largest part remains,<br />
Cut into junks a yard in length, and tied<br />
In small light bundles; load the broad-wheelâ€™d wane,<br />
The mules crook-harnest, and the sturdier crew,<br />
With sweet abundance. As on Lincoln-plains,<br />
(Ye plains of Lincoln sound your Dyerâ€™s praise!)<br />
When the lavâ€™d snow-white flocks are numerous pennâ€™d;<br />
The senior swains, with sharpenâ€™d shears, cut off<br />
The fleecy vestment; others stir the tar;<br />
And some impress, upon their captives sides,<br />
Their masterâ€™s cypher; while the infant throng<br />
Strive by the horns to hold the struggling ram,<br />
Proud of their prowess. (3.93â€“94.111â€“16, 125â€“38)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here, Grainger presents the cane as practically harvesting itself,
omitting the subject of the verbs â€œeaseâ€ and â€œlops.â€ Sugarcane â€œquivers
in their hand with fond impatience,â€ presenting harvesters as merely
collecting the plants that naturally and spontaneously arise from an
ever-fruitful landscape. And while Grainger briefly mentions the
specific labor that harvesting cane requires, specifying that workers
had to cut the cane into â€œjunks a yard in lengthâ€ and tie them into
â€œsmall light bundles,â€ he refers to the enslaved who would have been
doing this work as â€œswains,â€ obscuring the conditions under which they
labored. He also evokes a more traditionally pastoral subject by turning
from the harvesting of cane to the shearing of sheep. Nevertheless, in
these lines, the description of the sheep as â€œcaptivesâ€ harkens back to
the status of the enslaved themselves, and Grainger even encodes the
common practice of branding enslaved laborers by describing the branding
of sheep with their â€œmasterâ€™s cypher.â€ In this sense, the poem fails to
use aestheticized tropes and language to suppress the mismatch between
plantation agriculture and idealized, Virgilian cultivation.<sup id="fnref:f7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:f7" class="footnote">7</a></sup></p>

<p>Such moments when Graingerâ€™s awareness of the realities of enslavement
cannot be mediated through poetic language appear throughout the poem.
In particular, he has considerable difficulty obscuring the harsh and
brutal realities of living and working on a sugar plantation. For
example, as Grainger narrates the process of feeding cane stalks into
the mill to extract their sugary syrup,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>AND now thy mills dance eager in the gale;<br />
Feed well their eagerness: but O beware;<br />
Nor trust, between the steel-casâ€™d cylinders,<br />
The hand incautious: off the member snapt<br />
Thouâ€™lt ever rue; sad spectacle of woe! (3.95.165â€“69).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The footnote that follows reads, â€œThis accident will sometimes happen,
especially in the night: and the unfortunate wretch must fall a victim
to his imprudence or sleepiness, if a hatchet do not immediately strike
off the entangled member; or the mill be not instantly put out of wind,â€
by which Grainger means that the sugar mill, powered by wind, would stop
turning (95). Personifying the mills as he previously did the sugarcane
to avoid commenting on the harsh conditions of the plantation, Grainger
is nevertheless still forced to confront the dangers that the enslaved
faced every day. Even so, he seeks to compartmentalize blame,
characterizing the hand of the enslaved as â€œincautiousâ€ and the laborer
as imprudent or sleepy, while omitting the fact that enslavers during
the height of sugarcane harvesting forced laborers to work around the
clock with no rest.</p>

<p>This rhetorical strategy serves an underlying goal: Grainger primarily
used these instances to promote amelioration, arguing that if plantation
owners made conditions more bearable and engaged in â€œhumaneâ€ treatment
of the enslaved, they would experience higher profits. Put another way,
by treating the enslaved as kindly as actual swains, Grainger believed
plantation yields (including his own profits) would increase.<sup id="fnref:f8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:f8" class="footnote">8</a></sup> At
the same time, emphasizing the â€œeagernessâ€ of the mill and its resulting
goods depicts ongoing plantation production as practically inevitable, a
logic necessary in a poem that demonstrates the West Indiesâ€™ importance
to the British Empire. By using poetic language to navigate these
discussions, <em>The Sugar-Cane</em> presents improved conditions and
sustained production as related goals, allowing those in power in the
Caribbean and Britain to continue profiting from plantation production.</p>

<p>The above passage about the feeding of cane into the mill also reveals
how Grainger utilized both the body of the poem and its footnotes to
establish his narrative authority. While the poem as a whole functions
as a georgic, it is in the footnotes that Grainger could include
specific and concrete examples of his expertise in plantation life.
Grainger used this space of the poem to comment on the day-to-day
operations of a St. Kitts plantation as well as to include information
about the medicinal uses of various plants and to make extensive
references to other scientific and agricultural texts about the
Caribbean islands more broadly. It is thus in the footnotes that the
â€œWest-Indiaâ€ modifier of the poem is most visible, as Grainger offers
Latinate plant names and histories of their applications, at times
noting their geographic spread and trade distribution. With such
explanations, he sought to include himself in the prestigious circles of
natural historians whose works were highly valued and widely circulated
amongst British audiences in the long eighteenth century.<sup id="fnref:f9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:f9" class="footnote">9</a></sup></p>

<p>These footnotes, however, often specify Afro-Caribbean and indigenous
use of plants, and, although Grainger does not explicitly identify his
sources or instructors, the glimpses they afford of marginalized
knowledge indicate the extent to which his expertise derived from that
of others. Beth Fowkes Tobin has pointed out, for example, that even
though Grainger attempts to categorize enslaved Africans themselves as
plants, animals, and other natural objects, carefully reading his
footnotes underscores direct links between the produce grown by the
enslaved on provision grounds or gardens and Graingerâ€™s lengthy
descriptions of tropical plants.<sup id="fnref:f10" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:f10" class="footnote">10</a></sup> Indeed, on the mountainous
island of St. Kitts, plantations were typically located along the
coasts, with provision grounds located in the less rich soil of the
rockier terrains of the mountains, a wide swath of land in regard to the
island as a whole.<sup id="fnref:f11" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:f11" class="footnote">11</a></sup> Building on Tobinâ€™s analysis, Britt Rusert
argues that the proliferation of footnotes in Graingerâ€™s poem signals
Graingerâ€™s fears about the â€œdisorderingâ€ potential of â€œtropical
diseases, wild animals, and maroon communitiesâ€ and reveals the
fragility of plantation order that he was trying to construct via his
poem.<sup id="fnref:f12" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:f12" class="footnote">12</a></sup> In these studies, then, Grainger emerges as a figure who
sought to order Caribbean nature based on colonial models and desires
but failed to do so because of the realities of the islandâ€™s geography
and resistance of its inhabitants, and scholars have recast <em>The
Sugar-Cane</em> as a work that reveals networks of expertise subtending his
own, singular performance of authorship. With the footnotes that sprawl
across his pages, Grainger seeks to place his own knowledge at the
center of the poem and readerâ€™s experience, but, simultaneously, these
footnotes attest to other forms of knowledge emerging from the
peripheries.<sup id="fnref:f13" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:f13" class="footnote">13</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="the-design-of-digital-grainger">The Design of <em>Digital Grainger</em></h2>

<p>How exactly to replicate and represent these footnotes, however, has
been a question for those seeking to create editions of the poem.
Perhaps because he was so anxious to demonstrate his knowledge of
nature, Grainger often included footnotes that took up more space on his
pages than his lines of verse. Editors therefore have utilized divergent
strategies for dealing with Graingerâ€™s footnotes. For example, John
Gilmoreâ€™s <em>Poetics of Empire</em>, which contains the complete text of the
poem and extensive annotations by Gilmore, places Graingerâ€™s footnotes
at the end of the poem and therefore presents them as endnotes.
Conversely, Thomas W. Krise includes the complete text of the poem in
his anthology <em>Caribbeana</em> but tries to replicate Graingerâ€™s footnote
arrangement by positioning them at the bottom of the poemâ€™s pages. Yet
because Graingerâ€™s footnotes take up so much room, there is no place to
put Kriseâ€™s own annotations and explanations on the same page as the
lines of verse, forcing Krise to separate them from the poem and include
this information only as endnotes. Such a move is far from ideal, since,
as the history of the poem suggests, Graingerâ€™s poem and particularly
its proplantation sympathies need considerable contextualization for
present-day readers to maintain the goal of challenging Graingerâ€™s
colonial vision.</p>

<span class="caption">An example of Grainger's extensive footnotes.</span>
    
</div>

<p>As such, one of the main aims of creating <em>Digital Grainger</em> was to
use the possibilities afforded by a digital edition to circumvent the
space limitations faced by editors of print editions of the
poem.<sup id="fnref:f14" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:f14" class="footnote">14</a></sup> While we wanted to reproduce the poem in its entirety for
those who might want to read or teach the whole text, we also wanted to
surround and, more importantly, to challenge Graingerâ€™s lengthy poem and
footnotes with our own substantial commentary on Afro-Caribbean and
indigenous experiences.</p>

<p>The <em>Digital Grainger</em> team therefore made the decision to produce not
one but multiple versions of the poem. Two of these versions appear in a
section of <em>Digital Grainger</em> that is called â€œThe 1764 Edition.â€ Both
versions include the complete text of Graingerâ€™s poem and all of
Graingerâ€™s footnotes. The two versions differ, however, in how they
present the poem to readers: (1) the â€œfull textâ€ version includes the
entire poem and all of Graingerâ€™s footnotes on one webpage, and (2) the
â€œpage-by-pageâ€ version presents readers with individual pages of the
poem, which they can click through. In the page-by-page version, we
replicated the layout of the original 1764 edition in the sense that we
numbered our pages in the same way that the 1764 editionâ€™s pages were
numbered, and we included the same text on each of our pages that was on
the corresponding pages of the 1764 edition. We also included in this
version links to scanned images of pages from the 1764 edition.</p>

<span class="caption">An example of a single page in *Digital Grainger*.</span>
    
</div>

<p>In other words, the versions included in â€œThe 1764 Editionâ€ section of
<em>Digital Grainger</em> were produced in accordance with many of the
standard conventions of scholarly editing. We included the entire poem,
and we also tried to give readers a sense of how the poem looked when it
appeared in 1764. The versions we present in â€œThe 1764 Editionâ€ section,
in fact, could be viewed as forming a semidiplomatic edition of the
poem, since we largely treated the poem as a historical document and
reproduced the language from the 1764 edition without any corrections to
standardize Graingerâ€™s spelling or punctuation.<sup id="fnref:f15" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:f15" class="footnote">15</a></sup> We also
triple-checked our transcription to ensure accuracy.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, even while committing to a faithful reproduction of
Graingerâ€™s words, we made several design choices to introduce
alternative, nonhegemonic modes of interpreting <em>The Sugar-Cane</em>. Our
first major intervention comes with our site design, which attends to
the embodied and material conditions of the digital archive.<sup id="fnref:f16" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:f16" class="footnote">16</a></sup>
Our transcriptions are built from Markdown files, and the site itself
was created using Ed, a Jekyll theme designed under the principles of
minimal computing.<sup id="fnref:f17" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:f17" class="footnote">17</a></sup> As a result, the site is static in regard to
user generation and does not require constant interaction with a server
to load. This decision to minimize the amount of markup meant that our
team primarily worked with Markdown, HTML (hypertext markup language),
and CSS (cascading style sheets), resulting in a site that can be loaded
on lower internet capacities. Most importantly, this design enables
access from those living in the Caribbean, for although the world is
going increasingly digital, access to these resources and preservation
of material remains uneven. And because this access also impacts what
devices are available to users, <em>Digital Grainger</em> is designed to load
on a variety of screen sizes, from computer and laptop to tablet and
phone. Additionally, replicating the full text of <em>The Sugar-Cane</em>
provides readers with free, online versions of the poem, otherwise
primarily available through the aforementioned printed editions or in
databases behind institutional paywalls.</p>

<p>The second major intervention involves the contextual materials that we
provide to readers, in the hope that these will enable them to see
through Graingerâ€™s elisions of enslaved and indigenous authority. To
achieve this goal, the <em>Digital Grainger</em> team added more than seven
hundred footnotes explaining terms used by Grainger. And while many
annotations explain Graingerâ€™s numerous classical allusions (derived
from Virgil and Greco-Roman contexts), many of the notes also include
botanical information about Afro-Caribbean and indigenous uses of
plants. This choice reflects the projectâ€™s goal of highlighting the
expansive networks of expertise and agency that exist at the periphery
of Graingerâ€™s original poem. Especially since space limitations were not
a consideration, <em>Digital Grainger</em> did not have to limit the number
of editorial footnotes added to Graingerâ€™s text. We were therefore able
to â€œsurroundâ€ Graingerâ€™s text with our own commentary. Moreover, because
our footnotes are on the same page as Graingerâ€™s textâ€”again, since
there is no digital limit on the size of pagesâ€”readers have easy
access to them. As a result, while it could be said that â€œThe 1764
Editionâ€ primarily stages its interventions on the edges of the poem,
building frameworks underneath and around it rather than directly
intervening in the original text, the site design and editorial
footnotes intellectually, visually, and structurally challenge
Graingerâ€™s attempts to construct himself as uniquely knowledgeable and
give readers alternate contexts for understanding the poem.</p>

<h2 id="the-counter-plantation">The Counter-Plantation</h2>

<p>Our most explicit intervention comes via the section of the site called
â€œThe Counter-Plantation.â€ We borrow the term <em>counter-plantation</em> from
Jean Casimir, who first used it to characterize the historical
development of various economic, political, and social practices in
Haiti following independence. Moreover, this emphasis enabled an
epistemological rethinking of the daily life of those living under
enslavement and emancipation, opening possibilities of how to conceive
of their relations and communities in ways that were not solely aligned
with the violence and production of the plantation.<sup id="fnref:f18" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:f18" class="footnote">18</a></sup> Casimir and
Yvonne Acosta later used this term to describe elements of plantation
life in St. Lucia that helped the enslaved become independent
cultivators after emancipation, a stage toward the development of a
peasantry. These elements included provision grounds and gardens, which
the enslaved used to grow food crops for their own survival. Acosta and
Casimir explain that even though the enslaved living on plantations were
subject to strict discipline, the plantation nevertheless allowed for
forms of agency, however minor.<sup id="fnref:f19" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:f19" class="footnote">19</a></sup></p>

<p>Generally, this concept of the counter-plantation specifies a broader
theme in scholarship discussing plantation life: namely, the
contradiction between the â€œseverely constrainedâ€ nature of the
plantation and spaces of negotiation, agency, and creativity within the
institution, a distinction between what Michel-Rolph Trouillot calls the
model of the â€œideal plantationâ€ and the â€œdifferent types of realitiesâ€
that these spaces actually contained.<sup id="fnref:f20" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:f20" class="footnote">20</a></sup> Sidney W. Mintz argues
across multiple essays, for instance, that what is later characterized
as Afro-Caribbean resistance derives from â€œaccommodationsâ€ or
â€œadaptationsâ€ to plantation enslavement. Whether through producing their
own subsistence or selling commodities, Afro-Caribbean persons preserved
their humanity and asserted their individuality through â€œbuilt-in
oppositionsâ€ to the plantation, doing more than merely
surviving.<sup id="fnref:f21" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:f21" class="footnote">21</a></sup> As with Casimirâ€™s and Acostaâ€™s development of
â€œcounter-plantation,â€ Mintz focuses on the social, political, and
economic valences of land cultivation in provision grounds and gardens
in order to emphasize individual expression and creativity. This tension
between plantation control over subsistence and Afro-Caribbean agency
over these plots allows scholars like Woodville K. Marshall to emphasize
how the enslaved controlled their time and their modes of production in
these spaces. Of course, provision grounds and gardens are always
fraught, defined as much by attempts to limit the freedom of the
enslaved as they are by the ownership of such spaces by Afro-Caribbean
persons.<sup id="fnref:f22" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:f22" class="footnote">22</a></sup> Yet at the same time, they serve as a concrete site of
broader epistemological reframing, preserving Afro-Caribbean agency
within an institution thought to eliminate this possibility.</p>

<p><em>Digital Grainger</em> uses the framework of the counter-plantation both
thematically and methodologically. In its most literal interpretation,
this concept works as a rubric for identifying various forms of
Afro-Caribbean and indigenous botanical and agricultural knowledge
discussed in the projectâ€™s footnotes, like provision grounds.
Additionally, by taking the counter-plantation as an analytic prompt,
<em>Digital Grainger</em> also uses the term to signify strategies of
survival and resistance more broadly. Just as there could be agency
within the plantation system, there are also numerous moments of
creativity and negotiation built into the rhetoric and narrative of
Graingerâ€™s poem that point to dissent from the strictures of the
plantation. In order to identify these moments, â€œThe Counter-Plantationâ€
section of <em>Digital Grainger</em> contains several pages highlighting
themes ranging from â€œIndigenous Presenceâ€ and â€œProvision Groundsâ€ to
â€œObeahâ€ and â€œFire.â€ Each of these pages contains excerpts from the poem
related to the chosen theme, beginning with a headnote or short essay
written by team members to help readers understand the significance of
the theme and the selected passages.</p>

<span class="caption">The menu for *Digital Grainger*, which includes the section
  'The Counter-Plantation.'</span>
    
</div>

<p>Another way to describe what â€œThe Counter-Plantationâ€ section and the
various excerpts are doing is via the metaphor of breaking, in the sense
that we use the excerpts to break apart the poem and provide the reader
with only those passages that challenge and contradict Graingerâ€™s
overarching narrative of plantation success and harmony. As Risam has
noted, the paradigm of breaking is inherent to the work of digital
humanities as well as postcolonial studies. Bridging the two,
postcolonial digital humanities combines the creative and building
possibilities of â€œhackingâ€ with the mission of â€œreading the colonial
archives against the grain.â€<sup id="fnref:f23" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:f23" class="footnote">23</a></sup> Although excerpting is common
editorial practice for anthologies and similar works, we see our
excerpts as critical interventions, in the sense that they seek to
redirect the readerâ€™s attention from what Grainger considered important.
In other words, there is a kind of violence being performed on the text,
as is represented by the image on our homepage. This image is an
original work of art by Vanessa Lee that reproduces the 1764 editionâ€™s

version of the frontispiece, the cane has been broken apart by a rat, an
animal that Grainger discusses in the poem as a serious threat to cane
crops.</p>

<p>Following Kim Gallonâ€™s call to scholars to practice a black digital
humanities that uses digital tools to â€œbring forth the full humanity of
marginalized peoples,â€ however, we are concerned not merely with
breaking apart Graingerâ€™s poem and revealing its omissions.<sup id="fnref:f24" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:f24" class="footnote">24</a></sup>
Rather, our goal is to use the excerpts to highlight possibilities for
life even under the highly restrictive system of slavery and thereby to
enact â€œbreaking as a form of making anew.â€<sup id="fnref:f25" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:f25" class="footnote">25</a></sup> In Graingerâ€™s
sprawling, lengthy poem, moments of survival, fugitivity, and resistance
may seem isolated, but when collated and placed side by side, they begin
to create an alternate picture of the Caribbean that was always buried
in the poem and available for recovery. The digital counter-plantation
thus uses the flexibility of a digital edition to demonstrate the
structural nature of these modes of resistance to Graingerâ€™s poem as
well as our project, literally giving each theme its own space within
the site. In other words, the space of the digital translates the
analytic intervention of the counter-plantation into a design feature.
For example, in the excerpt â€œMovement,â€ we include a passage that
alludes to the fact that enslaved individuals often traveled between
plantations at night to visit family members and friends. Planters did
not approve of such movement because it occurred beyond their reach and
control. As Grainger warns his readers, whom he imagines in this moment
to be planters,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>COMPEL by threats, or win by soothing arts,<br />
Thy slaves to wed their fellow slaves at home;<br />
So shall they not their vigorous prime destroy,<br />
By distant journeys, at untimely hours,<br />
When muffled midnight decks her raven-hair<br />
With the white plumage of the prickly vine. (4.158.606â€“11)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That Grainger would disapprove of such traveling is not surprising, of
course, given the overall investment of his poem in support of the
plantation system. Nevertheless, Graingerâ€™s lines inadvertently reveal
the multifarious and sometimes unexpected uses to which the botanical
knowledge of the enslaved could be deployed. When Grainger describes the
â€œwhite plumage of the prickly vine,â€ he is referring to the flower
commonly known as night-blooming cereus (<em>Selenicereus grandiflorus</em>),
the large, white petals of which have an opalescent quality to allow
them to be seen at night by moths and other nocturnal pollinators. In
this case, however, Graingerâ€™s reference to the flower in lines that
discuss the travels of enslaved individuals suggests that they, too,
could have been using the reflected light from its petals to navigate.
As such, putting â€œMovementâ€ next to other excerpts like â€œProvision
Grounds,â€ which also discusses Afro-Caribbean botanical knowledge, means
that readers can begin to see this knowledge as extensive enough to
undergird networks of escape and autonomy versus fragmentary and
scattered.<sup id="fnref:f26" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:f26" class="footnote">26</a></sup> These moments are built into the space of the
plantation and Graingerâ€™s georgic poem, allowing us to rethink how we
imagine the projects of both.</p>

<p>Our decision to focus on these moments from the poem was inspired in
large part by Nicole Aljoeâ€™s work to identify the â€œembedded narrativesâ€
of and by the enslaved in colonial historical texts. Notably, while
Aljoeâ€™s analysis of such narratives serves as the topic of her book,
<em>Creole Testimonies: Slave Narratives of the British West Indies,
1709â€“1838</em>, this strategy has been mobilized by the <em>Early Caribbean
Digital Archive</em> as well, which identifies the speakers and subjects of
these embedded narratives as creators equivalent to those who wrote and
published the texts (Aljoe is one of the primary creators of the
<em>ECDA</em>). In other words, the <em>ECDA</em> is also interested in finding
methods for distributing agency and authority, and the creators of the
<em>ECDA</em> similarly seek to â€œdisrupt, review, question, and reviseâ€
colonial knowledge.<sup id="fnref:f27" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:f27" class="footnote">27</a></sup> More broadly, both Aljoeâ€™s scholarship at
the level of individual texts and the <em>ECDA</em>â€™s intervention at the
level of the archive echo Saidiya Hartmanâ€™s call for scholars to craft
â€œcounter-histories of slaveryâ€ or counter-narratives seeking to
illuminate the experiences of the enslaved by disrupting the colonial
archive.<sup id="fnref:f28" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:f28" class="footnote">28</a></sup></p>

<p>In contrast to the embedded narratives highlighted by the <em>ECDA</em>, the
passages excerpted by <em>Digital Grainger</em> are not openly attributed to
or associated with particular enslaved or marginalized individuals and
lack any markers of quotation, interaction, or speech. Yet the gestures
Grainger makes to alternative forms of survival and knowledge allow us
to identify other sources of expertise and resistance, even as they
remain unnamed, and thereby to take another approach to the construction
of counter-narratives and counter-histories. Especially because so much
work has been done by historians and other scholars of colonial science
and agriculture, we know that Grainger would have relied on conversation
and exchangeâ€”although often coercedâ€”with Afro-Caribbean and other
marginalized individuals for his information about plants, and one of
our goals is highlighting the fact of these anonymous interactions, even
if we cannot identify the exact individuals with whom Grainger
spoke.<sup id="fnref:f29" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:f29" class="footnote">29</a></sup></p>

<p>Indeed, the long history of Caribbean exchange, encounter, and
colonization is a central theme in â€œThe Counter-Plantationâ€ section and
its excerpts. In particular, the excerpt â€œIndigenous Presenceâ€ reckons
with the long traditions of indigenous knowledge that <em>The Sugar-Cane</em>
draws on. For instance, Graingerâ€™s inclusion of indigenous words such as
<em>Liamuiga</em> and <em>suirsaak</em> indicates a connection to the natural
knowledge of Kalinago Caribs or Arawaks. Whether or not these words were
directly spoken to Grainger by indigenous persons or presented as
inherited knowledge by Afro-Caribbean and other individuals, these
gestures denote genealogies of expertise that manifest themselves in
<em>The Sugar-Cane</em> despite Graingerâ€™s attempts to establish and
stabilize his own narrative authority. In fact, tracing such references
highlights how he relegates most mentions of indigenous communities and
knowledge to the footnotes. By collecting these footnoted moments,
â€œIndigenous Presenceâ€ brings these peripheral annotations to the
foreground to demonstrate the depth of Amerindian botanical and
ecological knowledge. With this strategy, we thus expand the ways
scholars can recognize authorship and authority, even when explicit
citations and quotations of named contributors are absent.<sup id="fnref:f30" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:f30" class="footnote">30</a></sup></p>

<p>Nevertheless, this anonymity is itself a possible limitation of our
project. As Acosta and Casimir explain, the counter-plantation was a
â€œsystem in opposition to, but dependent upon, the plantation.â€<sup id="fnref:f31" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:f31" class="footnote">31</a></sup>
While the excerpts in â€œThe Counter-Plantationâ€ section demonstrate the
possibilities of life and agency that oppose the order of the plantation
while existing within it, our recognition of these instances continues
to remain dependent on the plantation system and the literature it
produced. In her theorization of counter-histories, Hartman grapples
with the simultaneous â€œnecessityâ€ and â€œinevitable failureâ€ to represent
â€œthe lives of the subaltern, the dispossessed, and the enslaved.â€ This
failure arises from the contours of the colonial archive, which is
fundamentally shaped by histories of violence against marginalized
subjects.<sup id="fnref:f32" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:f32" class="footnote">32</a></sup> As a result, our analysis at times must rely on
general discussions of Afro-Caribbean and indigenous resistance and
agency across the West Indies rather than St. Kitts specifically, or to
merely note the absences and gaps in Graingerâ€™s narration that open
possibilities for other interpretations. Indeed, many of our choices,
including our decision to produce an edition that challenges <em>The
Sugar-Cane</em>, harken back to what Ã‰douard Glissant terms
â€œcounterpoetics,â€ which always establishes itself in opposition to, and
thus in relation to, the order of colonization. Because we must
constantly refer back to a colonial text in order to recognize alternate
networks of agency and resistance, <em>The Sugar-Cane</em> maintains a
central place in our analysis, even as we seek to decentralize
Graingerâ€™s authority, enacting what Glissant notes is a â€œforced poeticsâ€
that struggles to break free of the constraints of colonial
discourse.<sup id="fnref:f33" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:f33" class="footnote">33</a></sup></p>

<p>This limitation, however, can be viewed as productive, for it reminds us
that the digital does not resolve the structural and historical problems
that we have inherited in the form of the colonial archive. As Leah
Rosenberg prompts us to recognize, â€œThe digital age places significant
responsibility on scholars to redress the marginalisation of Caribbean
literature and to ensure its future.â€<sup id="fnref:f34" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:f34" class="footnote">34</a></sup> These strategies of
redress can and should take multiple forms, and the limits of <em>Digital
Grainger</em> provide an opportunity to reflect on the numerous
possibilities a turn to the digital can authorize, particularly in
regard to a counter-edition. Because <em>Digital Grainger</em> both maintains
an accessible version of an eighteenth-century text and contextualizes
and decenters Graingerâ€™s authority through local networks of exchange,
expertise, and resistance, its approach to the epistemological
creativity of the counter-plantation assumes a form defined by breaking
the words and voice of the poem apart. The creativity inherent to the
counter-plantation, though, provides deep ground for further development
of alternatives. As with our own counter-edition, these alternatives can
focus thematicallyâ€”on the sonic or geographic experience of St. Kitts
and Afro-Caribbean lifeâ€”or through experiential designs, including
spaces for underrepresented communities to contribute or develop their
own narratives or paths of movement across the landscape.<sup id="fnref:f35" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:f35" class="footnote">35</a></sup>
Ultimately, as further editions and projects are built, they can in turn
reference and respond to one another, building conversations and
interpretations that further deauthorize colonial works like <em>The
Sugar-Cane</em>.</p>

<p>Most of all, as we strive to meet this responsibility, we must resist
the urge to assume that we can speak for those silenced in the archive
or present narrative forms from the colonial period completely
independent of the plantation system and the literatures that it
produced. Decolonization requires more than breaking apart colonial
narratives. While <em>Digital Grainger</em> provides readers with strategies
to nuance, complicate, and resist Graingerâ€™s authority, it and similar
projects must continually confront and actively work against the
possibility that digitizing a colonial text simply replicates
long-standing forms of silence, bringing the same careful reading and
analysis to our own work as we do to works of the past.</p>
