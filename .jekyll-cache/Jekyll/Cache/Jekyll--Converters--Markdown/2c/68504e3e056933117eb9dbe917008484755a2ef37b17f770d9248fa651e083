I"¸<p>My studentsâ€™ reaction to discovering (belatedly, they feel) the facts of the Haitian Revolution never ceases to surprise me. Many of them have never heard of this miracle, in which the slaves of the French colony of Saint-Domingue rose up against their masters in 1791â€”often armed only with tools from the canefieldsâ€”and, forging alliances with various parties, waged an eleven-year-long war against the major European militaries fighting to keep them under the heel of colonial servitude, to declare in 1804 the sovereignty of their own country, the first black republic of Haiti. This gap in my studentsâ€™ education is sometimes met with wonder, hurt, and even <em>anger</em>â€”an anger directed at the US-American high school history curriculum. But what is perhaps even stranger than this lacuna in their schooling, or their reaction to its revelation, is the fact that many of them may have encountered the Haitian Revolution, or at least its prehistory, without even realizing it, perhaps not in the AP History classroom but in playing X-box on a Saturday morning: the Haitian Revolution has provided the context for at least two recent games in videogame manufacturer Ubisoftâ€™s Assassinâ€™s Creed franchiseâ€”<em>Liberation</em> and <em>Freedom Cry</em>.</p>

<p>In brief, the texts this article engages are at once mainstream entertainment videogames and interactive tales of defiant people of color in the colonial era. The playable protagonists are the descendants of Africans imported to the Caribbean sugar colonies, working to free themselves and others, fighting alongside, and sometimes disguised as, slaves. My concern, as I began to investigate these AAA titles, was to determine whether Haitiâ€™s legacy of slave resistance was being reduced to an entertainment commodity and what kind of experience was being offered to the player in allowing him or her an experiential role in that history. In considering what kind of depiction of slave revolt is fostered by such games, several issues came to the foreground. First, does the developersâ€™ act of drawing on Haitian history truly expand a gamerâ€™s knowledge of historical resistance in the Atlantic world, or is this enfolding of Haitian history into the fictional world of the game merely an act of what theorist bell hooks might call â€œeating the otherâ€?<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">1</a></sup> Second, does the game, whether historically accurate or not, appear to foster empathy for the historical rebel slave, as some educational and art games about runaway slaves arguably do?<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">2</a></sup> Or does it instead prioritize the playability of this subject position in a problematic manner, bringing the rebel slave of Saint-Domingue under the control of the contemporary gamer, chiefly, for fun? None of these questions proved simple to answer. In this piece, Iâ€™ll adumbrate the various complexities of the gamesâ€™ representations of Caribbean slave revolt.</p>

<p>As this article emphasizes, the history of Saint-Domingue, in particular, plays a key role in both games. <em>Liberation</em> and <em>Freedom Cry</em> make problematic use of the prehistory of the Haitian Revolution as a kind of backdrop or subtext to the action at hand, potentially reducing the historical subject of Saint-Domingue into a present-day commodity, or allowing a kind of digital collaboration in a fictive version ofâ€”and perhaps then, a kind of narrative rewriting ofâ€”the slave revolts of Saint-Domingue. Yet despite the gamesâ€™ flaws, there are at once subversive and productive aspects of their construction that resist the gamerâ€™s attempt to master the art of slave rebellion.</p>

<p>The complexity of this issue can best be introduced by performing a brief visual analysis. The Assassinâ€™s Creed games include a recurring device in which, at certain moments of the gameplay, the player, having climbed to a designated â€œviewpointâ€ (a high vantage above the city or countryside), hits the button to achieve â€œsynchronizationâ€â€”meaning that, in the fictional world of the game, the player is on track to completion of the gameâ€™s challenges. When the player hits the button to synchronize, the perspective pulls back from the protagonist, as if there were a camera floating in mid-airâ€”a shot that in film could only be accomplished by a helicopter or droneâ€”and does a 360-degree rotation of the character, revealing the panorama of the surrounding space. Accompanied by the swelling music of the gameâ€™s soundtrack, these are beautiful vistas that exhibit the designersâ€™ artistry, the lavish detail of the gameâ€™s architecture of the city, and the historical accuracy of the engineered setting. But thematically, such moments do double duty: first, they present the world that is laid out at the playerâ€™s feet, as if to say, â€œBehold, this is your digital playground,â€ but, second, it pulls back from the playable character, both visually and ludically (a term that in the context of game studies means concerning the mode of play): after hitting the button, the player is rendered immobile until the panoramic tour is finishedâ€”such devices emphasize the construction of the text, the playerâ€™s ensconcement in a digital world over which he, really, has little control. Such moments, then, in all the Assassinâ€™s Creed games, emphasize the duality of the playerâ€™s control and lack of control.</p>

<p>These kinds of viewpoints, a hallmark of the game franchise, may take on a special significance when the context of the gameâ€™s drama is a narrative of colonization or imperialism, as in both of the games I discuss here, as the panorama is a visual apparatus historically connected to conquest, dating back to its development in scenes of French battles and World Exhibitions.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">3</a></sup> Here I am thinking of Vivian Sobchakâ€™s discussion of the visual in terms of possession. â€œIn his phenomenological description of human vision,â€ Sobchak writes, â€œMerleau-Ponty tells us, â€˜To see is to <em>have</em> <em>at a distance</em>.â€™â€<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">4</a></sup> On the history of the panorama in World Exhibitions, Lieven de Cauter writes, â€œIn the panorama the capitalist need for spatial expansion was, as it were, transferred to perception: the â€˜all-encompassing viewâ€™ becomes an aesthetic experience of the first order. The viewer of a panorama takes enjoyment from a distant reality that can be possessed, that is always on the verge of being annexed or colonized.â€<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote">5</a></sup> The panoramic view of colonial territory should always be thought in terms of the bodies and space that are claimed as a part of the act of viewing. But it is worth noting that these viewpoints actually operate like panoramas in reverse: rather than illustrating the space from the point of view of the character in a 360-degree rotation of his or her gaze, the â€œcameraâ€ swings out to show the protagonist atop his or her perch. In performing this perspective gyre, the protagonist is diminished in comparison to the space aroundâ€”she or he becomes a part of the space to be claimed, and by aligning the gamerâ€™s perspective with a disembodied, imaginary camera, the viewer is reminded that it is the game designer, and not the gamer, who has the ultimate control.</p>

<p>In these viewpoint moments, then, we find a spectacle containing the various complications inherent in the games I wish to examine. Do they offer players, many of whom may well be students encountering this history for the first time, some type of ownership of these rebel slave characters, or of the history of slave revolt, or of the colonial spaces in which the narratives are set (here, French New Orleans and colonial Saint-Domingue), or do they merely tease the player with the possibility that she or he might, in playing the game, come to possess such narratives and histories but ultimately foreclose this annexation? I argue that it is in moments such as these, which disrupt the playerâ€™s absorption in the gameâ€”as if to remind her or him of the fact of the engineered fictionâ€”that we can locate a subversive gesture that ultimately denies the player ownership of the historical rebel slaveâ€™s subject position. We will begin our study with a game that, set in French-controlled New Orleans, depicts various characters with ties to Saint-Domingue, and thus draws on Haitian history, before addressing a game that is explicitly set in the colony of Saint-Domingue during the prehistory of the Haitian Revolution.</p>

<p><em>Assassinâ€™s Creed: Liberation</em>, a production of Ubisoft Sofia and Ubisoft Montreal, takes place in French New Orleans one hundred years before the American Civil War. In the game, the player incarnates a free woman of color, Aveline de GrandprÃ©, who is the product of a female slave from Saint-Domingue and the slaveâ€™s white master; Aveline is our titular â€œAssassinâ€ and playable protagonist. Having lost her mother when she just a child, Aveline was raised by her white father and stepmother, wealthy merchants. The game begins with a flashback to the moment of her childhood trauma, in which the young Aveline sees slaves being auctioned on the block and then is separated from her mother in the marketplace. This â€œcutscene,â€ a cinematic interlude in which the player has no control, is in fact a dream, and Aveline awakens to find herself in the year 1763, where she is a young lady of privilege, dividing her time between elegant society and freedom-fighting missions as an assassin.</p>

<p>The Assassinâ€™s Creed franchise prides itself on its historical realismâ€“â€“its accurate representations of geographical spaces, use of languages other than the playerâ€™s chosen setting, and inclusion of recognizable historical figures in supporting roles. As a testament to the designersâ€™ diligence, each game is prefaced with the following note: â€œInspired by historical events and characters, this work of fiction was designed, developed, and produced by a multicultural team of various religions, faiths, and beliefs.â€<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote">6</a></sup> But aside from the purported historical realism of the in-game play, the Assassinâ€™s Creed franchise also features secret societies, time travel, and an alien race, though these are not my primary concern here. Suffice it to say that the intrigue framing all the games concerns a long-standing war between the Brotherhood of the Assassins and the secretive order of the Templars, who wage their battles throughout history by means of a device called the Animus, which allows characters to access their ancestorsâ€™ memories and, in a virtual sense, to be transported back in time.</p>

<p><em>Liberation</em>â€™s gameplay includes a series of missions, some of which are concerned with the treatment of slaves whom Aveline aids in their escape to the bayou, or the investigation of their disappearance and displacement to the colony of Chichen Itza in Mexico, but most of which are about battles for territorial control among corrupt colonial governors and conflict among smugglers in the swamplands. The theme of liberating the slaves is present here, though it seems subsidiary to Avelineâ€™s efforts to uncover the truth about her motherâ€™s involvement with the assassin syndicate and her subsequent disappearance. At the same time, somewhat mysteriously, Aveline becomes involved in her fatherâ€™s shipping business. In one mission, she buys out one of her fatherâ€™s merchant competitors in order to pay his slaves a living wage, thereby liberating them via capitalism. In short, despite Avelineâ€™s stated goals (which are, as she tells her mentor, AgatÃ©, also from Saint-Domingue and a friend of her motherâ€™s, to â€œfree the slaves, defeat [their] enemies, impose justiceâ€), for most of the game there is an absence of a radical abolitionist message.</p>

<p>Troublingly, the game incorporates into its fiction the historical personage of FranÃ§ois Makandal, maroon leader of Saint-Domingue, whose efforts at poisoning the white slaveholding community some historians consider to be the first chapter of the Haitian Revolution.<sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote">7</a></sup> Aveline battles a bayou <em>houngan</em> who calls himself â€œFranÃ§ois Mackandalâ€<sup id="fnref:9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote">8</a></sup> and is in league with the corrupt Spanish official Raphael Joachim de Ferrer, who seeks control of the colony. â€œThe False Mackandal,â€ as the <em>houngan</em> character is called in the game (it is later revealed that his name is actually Baptiste) was formerly acquainted with both AgatÃ© and Avelineâ€™s mother, Jeanne. Like the real Makandal, Baptiste appears to be missing an arm, though this is never explained; he simply wears a feathered wing over one shoulder. Baptiste turns out to be the disciple of the historical Makandal, as were both AgatÃ© and Jeanne, when they worked as assassins for the brotherhood. As a part of Avelineâ€™s training, AgatÃ© gives her Makandalâ€™s blowpipe, which she uses to dispense darts dipped in â€œfast poisonâ€ to kill enemies silently and from afar. This incorporation of the history of Haiti, the gameâ€™s use of both Vodou and poison as strategies of slave subversion, might at first glance seem a successful homage to a proud legacy of resistance. For example, in a critical manner, there is a chapter called â€œThe Power of Voodoo,â€ in which AgatÃ© and Aveline exploit the Europeansâ€™ fears of the slavesâ€™ religion: Aveline thins out a patrol of soldiers crossing the bayou by using poison darts at points where AgatÃ© has placed some sort of fetishes he refers to as â€œVoodoo signsâ€; Avelineâ€™s stealthy poisoning makes the soldiers think they are cursed and they flee in terror. Using poison to play up the belief that the slaves had a command of supernatural forces references one effective strategy of slave resistance, but for every moment that seems productively critical of the colonial hegemony, there is a misstep that reinforces stereotypes and diminishes the gameâ€™s authenticity.<sup id="fnref:10" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote">9</a></sup></p>

<p>When Aveline seeks to kill the False Mackandal, the ally of her Spanish enemies, she must first reduce his forces; the acolytes with whom he surrounds himself are men of African descent who wear kilts and body paint similar to our ersatz prophet, including a feathered wing over one shoulder, creating a dramatic but inauthentic portrait of Vodou practitioners. At one point, the gameâ€™s directions read, â€œKill the thugs. Remain undetected,â€ in a use of the term <em>thug</em> that, although it may be appropriate here for its historical connection to religious assassins, has become increasingly problematic in recent years when applied to young black men, as these characters are. During the False Mackandalâ€™s dying confession, Aveline comes to understand her enemyâ€™s true identity and his relationship to the real Makandal. At this point, upon his death by her hand, Baptiste also discloses that he knows both AgatÃ© and her mother, which he conveys by recognizing the locket she wears. If this were the extent of the historical Makandalâ€™s inclusion in the narrative, it might merely raise an eyebrow as a questionable attempt at preserving historical realism in the game, but there is an underlying layer that must be revealed.</p>

</div>

<p>As mentioned above, the Assassinâ€™s Creed franchise involves a storyline about a company, Abstergo Industries, that facilitates the transportation back in time by means of a machine called the Animus device. Most of the games include a frame narrative about a white male character named Desmond Miles who relives his ancestorsâ€™ memories via the Animus. Scholars have made a point of noting that <em>Liberation</em> is the first game of the series in which Abstergo Industries offers its services to the general public. That is, in the world of the game, Aveline is <em>for sale</em>: her story is available not only to her ancestors but to anyone who will pay to play.<sup id="fnref:11" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote">10</a></sup> Therefore, implicit in both <em>Liberation</em> and <em>Freedom Cry</em> (the latter also absents the frame narrative about Desmond Miles) is the idea that some other person, perhaps <em>you</em> as the game player, incarnate the playable protagonist. The player has a more direct channel to the protagonist absent the frame narrative, making the playable character seem inhabited by the player him- or herself, a device that here parallels the slaveâ€™s appropriation by the master.</p>

<p>There is a subplot to <em>Liberation</em> in which a hacker called Erudito makes contact at various points in the narrative and offers â€œyouâ€ (the player incarnating our eighteenth-century heroine) revealing glimpses into the way the fictional foe Abstergo Industries has tampered with or redacted Avelineâ€™s storyline. In such moments, an electronic voiceover tells you to find a character called â€œCitizen Eâ€ and assassinate him; if you do so, you then replay a scene you have seen before, this time with modifications or extra lines that reveal â€œthe truthâ€ Abstergo presumably does not want you to know. The player may experience dÃ©jÃ  vu, as previously seen cutscenes repeat, this time with some distortion, as if a visual input cable had come loose on the back of the television. Each of these moments reveals more dialogue than was previously seen and offers a supposedly more satisfying picture: for example, the third reveal replays a conversation between Aveline and GÃ©rald Blanc, a business associate, would-be suitor, and sometime accomplice of our heroine, in which she expresses dissatisfaction that she cannot do more for the slaves: â€œA small gesture, hardly enough. I can offer them a wage, but what good is money without freedom?â€ Here she acknowledges that paying the slaves she frees does not undo the problems of the society at large. She also expresses feelings of powerlessness going up against the Templars, who will â€œnever allow the slaves to be free.â€ It may be that it is only these references to the Templars that are meant to be key revelations, but it is interesting to note that Eruditoâ€™s recoveries in this game consistently reveal more radical content, expressing the wider need for slave emancipation, for instance. We might say that such moments in the game are â€œmeta,â€ tacit acknowledgements of the way the programmers themselves have tampered with history.<sup id="fnref:12" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote">11</a></sup> Yet there is a potential hazard embedded in this aspect of the gameâ€™s narrative architecture and in the role the co-option of Haitian history and culture plays in this game, and one of the Erudito hacks speaks to this directly. Even as this game packages itself as progressive, and the Erudito hacks do reveal a more revolutionary narrative, the gameâ€™s construction of its own alternative history is not without complications.</p>

<p>The gameâ€™s first reference to its own manipulation of the history of Saint-Domingue is made in the governorâ€™s mansion, heard in the Templar Raphael Joachim de Ferrerâ€™s claim to his conspirator, the colonial French Governor Abbadie: â€œWeâ€™ll ensure the errors of Santo Domingo are not repeated here.â€ At first it might seem that he is referencing the historical Spanish loss of part of the island to French control, formally acknowledged in 1697â€™s Treaty of Ryswyck, but more likely this is a nod to a specific (fictional) instance related to the gameâ€™s characters.<sup id="fnref:13" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote">12</a></sup> It may even be read as a proleptic call-back to the game <em>Freedom Cry</em>, to which I will turn presently, made by Ubisoft later but taking place in Saint-Domingue in the year 1735, some thirty years <em>before</em> the action depicted in <em>Liberation</em>. Whatever this incident was that happened on the island, it is obviously important, for it is the subject of more than one of the cover-ups orchestrated by Abstergo and revealed to the player by Erudito.</p>

<p>Baptiste (the False Mackandal) admits to Aveline that he is not the real Makandal, but it is only by exposing the tampered-with history provided by Erudito, in the first hack of the game, that we discover what Baptisteâ€™s plan was: he tells de Ferrer, â€œThe nobles of New Orleans shall perish by poison, and the slaves shall be avenged. My mentorâ€™s work will be complete.â€ Of course, coming as this revelation does, <em>after</em> Aveline has assassinated the False Mackandal, implies that she has obstructed his goals for direct, violent action on the slave-master class and thereby thwarted the historical Makandalâ€™s strategy. Aveline has unwittingly protected the status quo. In this moment, then, the separation between Aveline and the player is underscored, since the player necessarily knows far more than does Aveline.</p>

<p>If this tampering with Haitiâ€™s history offends, one might take comfort in the fact that one can play through the game without learning much more about the historical Makandal. But if the player decides to collect the thirty pages of Avelineâ€™s motherâ€™s diary that are scattered throughout New Orleans, a more complete (and destructive) picture emerges. The leaves of paper, like Eruditoâ€™s hacks, clearly signify as histories that have to be uncovered.</p>

<p>In these pages, Jeanne gives us a portrait of her enslavement, of her â€œrelationshipâ€ with the Master De GrandprÃ©, Avelineâ€™s father, and of her involvement with the Brotherhood of Assassins. Most important for our purposes here, it is revealed that Jeanne was working in the resistance movement in Saint-Domingue with the true Makandal, but that she betrayed him when she refused to poison her kind mistress and the white children, setting a limit for what constitutes reasonable freedom fighting in the game. Jeanne, we learn, escaped Saint-Domingue after stealing an item precious to the brotherhood (presumably the locket Aveline has inherited, which is ultimately revealed as a key object in her quest), and she thereby impeded Makandalâ€™s efforts to emancipate the slaves of Saint-Domingue. Even, then, as the game purports to provide a heroic, emancipatory model, resistance is given limits: Avelineâ€™s mother attains freedom only when it is given to her by her lover-cum-slave-master, and in both Jeanneâ€™s story and, incidentally, in Avelineâ€™s assassination of Baptiste, white slaveholders are spared a grisly death by poisoning.</p>

<p>Further, the game implies that the historical slave rebel FranÃ§ois Makandal was a member of the fictional Brotherhood of Assassins, a move that is a troubling co-option of historical slave resistance by the entertainment industry. But even stranger, in one of Eruditoâ€™s hacks it may be implied that Makandalâ€™s poisonings were only ever a Templar plot gone awry: in an episode on Chichen Itza, de Ferrer reveals that they are having problems with runaways from this supposedly Edenic slave colony. Erudito reveals in a secret dialogue that de Ferrer had planned to â€œdoctor the workersâ€™ aleâ€ to keep them complacent, but he is reminded by his henchman that he previously has not had good luck with poison, which he acknowledges, saying, â€œPerhaps you are right, I donâ€™t want a repeat of the Mackandal debacle.â€ Does this imply that it was a poison engineered by the Templars and meant for the slaves that Mackandal planned to use against the masters (no matter which Makandal they mean to reference) or that they gave the historical Makandal the idea of using poison? Regardless, this edit seems to further rob Makandal of his legacy, whose prowess at developing subtle and sinister poisons is widely documented.<sup id="fnref:14" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote">13</a></sup></p>

<p>The historical Makandalâ€™s revolutionary command is gelded by his incorporation into this game, but his power is also sublimated. In the game Makandal is thwarted by Jeanne, Avelineâ€™s mother, and his brand of emancipation demonized by her refusal to participate. The lord of poison is depicted explicitly as a failure, a man who died without accomplishing his mission. That the Templars seem to take credit even for his mastery of poison was, to me, exceptionally problematic. Historical revision is endemic to the Assassinâ€™s Creed series, often in productive ways, but these tamperings with the past take on dangerous resonances, given that it is a legacy of slave resistance that is nerfed.<sup id="fnref:15" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote">14</a></sup></p>

<p>While the gameâ€™s appropriation and undercutting of Makandalâ€™s legacy and its representation of Saint-Domingue more broadly are certainly troubling, it is impossible to say definitively whether <em>Liberation</em> is ultimately successful as a socially conscious project drawing attention to the history of black resistance. Addressing this issue would demand a detailed study of player response, whereas my concern here is to read the game as a text, especially insofar as it translates a narrative of historical resistance into an interactive medium. As a text that is played, the game may offer black resistance to a wide audience of gamers, a possibility that has been thoroughly investigated by scholars such as Kishonna Gray and Jordan Mazurek, who address the â€œproblem of white gamingâ€ in their forthcoming essay â€œVisualizing Blacknessâ€”Racializing Gaming: Social Inequalities in Virtual Gaming Communities.â€<sup id="fnref:16" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote">15</a></sup> In the absence of a definitive answer to this question, I merely want to describe some of the ways that the complexity of participation in a narrative of slave resistance is treated within this particular gameâ€™s structure, and to draw attention to the high stakes of allowing a player to incarnate the historical slave or slave-in-revolt within the context of an interactive game.</p>

<p>The visual and ludic operations of the game work in a complex manner to dramatize player identification with the character. More than just moving bodies across a digital landscape, the videogames I consider here exhibit, in some sense, the â€œsecond-personâ€ conundrum, in that they compel the player to <em>become</em> the rebel slave, in much the same way that the inclusion of the second-person address in a literary text will draw the reader into the passage with the pronoun <em>you</em>.<sup id="fnref:17" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote">16</a></sup> Although these are not first person perspective games, and neither are they written in the second person, the player is nonetheless invited to identify with, to control, and to <em>be</em> a slave in revolt, which naturally has ramifications from the standpoint of â€œidentity tourism,â€ as the contemporary player dons a historical role that is not properly his or her own.<sup id="fnref:18" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote">17</a></sup> It is crucial to note, however, that visually, both <em>Liberation</em> and <em>Freedom Cry</em>, discussed below, are third person perspective games, meaning that the viewer sees the player-character on screen at all times, as opposed to in a first person perspective game, in which the player sees through what is called in cinema studies â€œsubjective camera,â€ as if she or he were inhabiting the body of the character. The player of the Assassinâ€™s Creed games may feel narratively, because of the frame narrative about the Animus machine, and ludically, because she mostly retains control over the bodyâ€™s movements on screen, that she has stepped into the protagonistâ€™s body, but visually she is given a somewhat conflicting vantage point. Therefore, some of the stickiness around identity occupation may be avoided by virtue of the fact that the â€œcameraâ€ is situated some feet above the playable character, thus holding open a space between the player and the character she or he pilots.<sup id="fnref:19" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote">18</a></sup></p>

<p>Because of the subject matter, too, we might link the occupation of the player-character in these games to discourse on the function of empathy in slave narratives. The issue of empathy has long been a fraught one in depictions of slavery, inasmuch as it redirects the slaveâ€™s suffering for the â€œenjoymentâ€ of others.<sup id="fnref:20" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote">19</a></sup> As Saidiya Hartman has written, â€œIt becomes clear that empathy is double-edged, for in making the otherâ€™s suffering oneâ€™s own, this suffering is occluded by the otherâ€™s obliteration.â€<sup id="fnref:21" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote">20</a></sup> In this narrative experience of the enslaved, the player is not concerned, really, with the slave himself but with the playerâ€™s own suffering in imagining her- or himself in his place. The danger is that the historical person has been effaced by the act of empathizing in this manner.</p>

<p>This issue of empathic occupation becomes even more complicated when we turn from the subjugation of the slave to the slaveâ€™s revolt as an experience to be recreated, in that it risks assimilating, commandeering, and even unwittingly subverting legacies of resistance. In addition to potentially fostering a problematic empathy, such games may allow for the assimilation of the radical emancipatory drive into the inventory of the entertainment economy. More broadly, and in a similar spirit to Hartmanâ€™s caveat, I remain skeptical of the potential of what Alison Landsberg calls â€œprosthetic memoryâ€ to allow the consumer to take on ancestral memories that properly belong to other groups. Landsberg reads the potential of â€œprosthetically appropriating memoriesâ€ as positive: it encourages empathy across social groups when, for example, a Gentile visits a Holocaust museum. <sup id="fnref:22" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote">21</a></sup> Though Landsbergâ€™s term fits the Assassinâ€™s Creed games, with their emphasis on reliving the memories of others, there is nonetheless a certain â€œempathy troubleâ€ produced by the spectatorâ€™s taking the place of the historical victim of oppression.<sup id="fnref:23" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote">22</a></sup></p>

<p>Videogames that capitalize on the history of slave resistance produce a potentially problematic act of occupation of the historically subjugated person, particularly when the player is invited to play <em>as</em> the slave or rebel slave. Although, as noted above, an exploration of the Assassinâ€™s Creed games in this respect would necessitate an in-depth reception study taking into account player demographics and responses, we can nevertheless acknowledge here that commoditizing the rebel slave as a playable protagonist risks â€œeating the [historical] Other,â€ to once again invoke hooksâ€™s description of cultural appropriation: â€œWhere the desire is not to make the Other over in oneâ€™s image but to <em>become</em> the Other.â€<sup id="fnref:24" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote">23</a></sup> However, I would like to propose that these gamesâ€™ interruption of their own â€œimmediacy,â€ that is, the mediaâ€™s invisibility as a medium, works against this problematic consumption.<sup id="fnref:25" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote">24</a></sup> Most simply stated, certain aspects of the game interrupt the immediacy of the gameplay. Absorption in the narrative is defied, and this serves to remind the gamer that she or he is merely a player. Like a defiance of continuity-editing in cinemaâ€”a jumpcut, for instanceâ€”these devices insist on the medium of the game and thereby interrupt the illusion that the player has become the character. This emphasis on the gameâ€™s media is on display in <em>Liberation</em> within Avelineâ€™s presentation as a character with triple personae.</p>

<span class="caption">Figure 2. This graphic from promotional materials associated with the game *Assassinâ€™s Creed: Liberation* illustrates Avelineâ€™s triple persona; from left to right: the assassin, the slave, and the lady.</span>
    
</div>

<p>Aveline has three costumes that she dons: the assassinâ€™s garb, the slaveâ€™s rags, and the ladyâ€™s gown. Each costume comes with different skill sets and elicits different treatment by the community as Aveline walks through the city. As Soraya Murray has suggested, we see in the diversity of this avatar and her ability to maneuver through society an illustration of the diversity of roles taken on by people of color in New Orleans.<sup id="fnref:26" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote">25</a></sup> That the manipulation of the same buttons on the controller will have different effects depending on whether the avatar is wearing the costume of the slave, the assassin, or the lady also undergirds the themes of slavery and freedom as they are manifested in the haptic dimensions of the game, since the player is aware of a range of her abilities and deficiencies. In the guise of the lady, for example, Avelineâ€™s mobility is somewhat restricted. On the other hand, she is swiftest and strongest in her assassinâ€™s garb. Avelineâ€™s polyvalence as a character, too, raises the specter of the collaborative effort of the slaves, free blacks, and wealthy mixed-race landowners to throw off the colonial yoke during the Haitian Revolution, as she alternately plays slave, assassin (and sometime Vodou initiate), and free lady of color. Significantly, Avelineâ€™s role as a fictional character in a deeply important history of resistance, which draws on her Saint-Dominguan heritage and is concretized by her possession of Vodou fetishes and poison blow darts in her arsenal, reveals the deeper <em>techne</em> of the game as rooted in role-playing. I want to suggest, then, that Avelineâ€™s triple nature also represents the player trying on different social and historical roles and serves as a reminder of the gameâ€™s fiction and of the playerâ€™s limitations within the game designerâ€™s algorithm.</p>

<p>At the same time that it depicts the diversity of colonial New Orleans, in part through Avelineâ€™s triple personae as signaling to the gamerâ€™s role play, so too <em>Liberation</em>â€™s use of language may remind the anglophone gamer of the medium and of her or his own limitations within an engineered digital space. Like the other games in the Assassinâ€™s Creed franchise, <em>Liberation</em> is multilingual, with important and even revelatory details spoken in French and left untranslated for the English speaker. For example, the comments of the passersby in New Orleans reveal how successfully or unsuccessfully Aveline is â€œpassingâ€ in her various guises.<sup id="fnref:27" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote">26</a></sup> There may also be snippets of African dialects included here; there were several times slaves spoke in a language I could not comprehend. Flagging the use of language as important in the game, in one instance a smuggler named Roussillion tries to pronounce a Creole wordâ€”â€houng . . . haung . . .â€â€”and then opts for its (insufficient) translation, â€œwitchdoctor.â€ The word he was looking for was, of course, <em>houngan</em>. This word and several other untranslated, unexplained concepts, such as <em>loas</em>, the Vodou divinities, point to the way language and culture makes communities, even within the society of gamers. The multilingualism of the game strikes me as an acknowledgement of the fact that players will have dissimilar experiences interacting with a gameâ€™s narrative. That a game changes depending on who is playing it is intrinsic to the medium, since a playerâ€™s skills and how much time she or he invests affect the end result, but the issue of player identity takes on specific complications in games about ownership of racial history and heritage, something the makers of the Assassinâ€™s Creed series, ostensibly about people reliving their ancestorsâ€™ memories, surely took into consideration. While not understanding all the dialogue in the game may not obstruct the enjoyment of the game for all players, it is certainly possible that encountering nonplayer characters that speak exclusively in a foreign tongue might interrupt full immersion in the narrative and even be frustratingâ€”as if the game means to withhold something. The multilingualism certainly lends to the realism of the gameâ€™s world, yet it seems also to serve to remind the player of her or his incomplete absorption of the narrative.<sup id="fnref:28" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote">27</a></sup> Here one might read together a line from Stuart Hallâ€™s famous essay â€œEncoding, Decodingâ€ with hooksâ€™s â€œEating the Otherâ€: â€œIf no â€˜meaningâ€™ is taken, there can be no <em>consumption</em>.â€<sup id="fnref:29" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote">28</a></sup> When the player encounters indecipherable content, she or he is faced with an uncompleted circuit, in Hallâ€™s parlance, and the sense that someone else, a player who speaks that language or the character whom she or he is playing, would likely be able to complete that circuit. These uncompleted circuits act like aporia that productively disrupt the playerâ€™s consummation of the character and the narrative. More concretely, language acts as a key element in the next game I discuss, which is set directly in colonial Saint-Domingue: <em>Freedom Cry</em>.</p>

<p>Whereas Haiti and its legacy of slave revolt is backdrop in <em>Liberation</em>, it is front and center in <em>Freedom Cry</em>, another game within the Assassinâ€™s Creed series. This is not a major release but what is called a DLC (downloadable content) and is an add-on for the game <em>Assassinâ€™s Creed 4:</em> <em>Black Flag</em>, about pirates in the Caribbean. In <em>Freedom Cry</em>, the player incarnates a character called AdewalÃ©, a former slave from a sugarcane plantation in Trinidad (and quartermaster to protagonist Edward Kenway in the pirate adventure) who journeys to Saint-Domingue, frees slaves, and falls in league with a band of maroons, led by a man called Augustin, who are waging a war against the colonial <em>gouverneur</em>. Set in 1735, the game draws explicitly on the prehistory of the Haitian Revolution, especially with its detailed depiction of an emancipation campaign carried out by the maroons, alongside whom AdewalÃ© fights.<sup id="fnref:30" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote">29</a></sup></p>

<span class="caption">Figure 3. A gameplay screenshot from *Freedom Cry*; AdewalÃ© is in the foreground.</span>
    
</div>

<p>Even more pronouncedly than <em>Liberation</em>, <em>Freedom Cry</em> makes the liberation of slaves the playerâ€™s chief labor in the game. Recruiting maroons along the way, AdewalÃ© liberates plantations and slave ships, ultimately winning a ship for the cause and teaching Augustin to man it for the coming â€œrevolution,â€ the objective of which is stated to be â€œmaroon independenceâ€ but which also necessarily alludes to the revolution that would lead to the creation of Haiti. As <em>Liberation</em> co-opts the historical Makandal, <em>Freedom Cry</em> coopts the maroons, implying that the fictional Brotherhood of Assassins had a role in laying the groundwork that would lead to the Haitian Revolution. This game, then, does not wholly manage to avoid problematic commodification of black resistance and a troubling appropriation of the history of Saint-Domingue. Yet at the same time, the gameâ€™s use of language ironically works to safeguard that history as something that is not available to anyone at the push of a button.</p>

<p><em>Freedom Cry</em> incorporates dialogue not only in French, the language of the colonists present in Saint-Domingue, but also in Haitian Kreyol; there are even some phrases in a Trinidadian dialect. As in <em>Liberation</em>, foreign languages in gameplay are untranslated for the gamer, even if one enables subtitles. Sometimes the slaves whom AdewalÃ© frees thank him in English, sometimes in French, and sometimes in Kreyol. In the cutscenes, the use of foreign languages is more spare, but with captions, one can read a translation in brackets (such as â€œ[Bully!]â€), though no transliteration of the word heard is given (in this case, â€œBaa Johnâ€) nor any indication of what language the character has spoken (here, Trinidadian Creole), lending a kind of mystery to the game, like a door through which one is not permitted to walk. In games about slave revolt, this trademark of the franchise works to particular effect in that such linguistic doors, to stick with the metaphor, allow only certain players to pass throughâ€”in many instances in <em>Freedom Cry</em>, for example, the very few players who speak Haitian Kreyol.</p>

<p>The first instance of Kreyol is heard from a slave whom AdewalÃ© saves from mutilation by an overseer. After taking hold of a package during a battle with a Templar fleet, AdewalÃ© shipwrecks just off the coast of Saint-Domingue. His first challenge comes when he stumbles upon a white overseer attacking a female slave and hissing threats (spoken only in French) that he will cut off her ears if she refuses to submit. After chasing down and killing the overseer, thus saving the slave woman, AdewalÃ© asks the spared victim in a cutscene how to find â€œBastienne JosÃ¨phe,â€ the intended recipient of the package he carries. The slave utters a phrase that I would transliterate as â€œMwen memn pa konnen!â€ (â€œMe, I donâ€™t know!â€), but this is translated in the closed captioning as â€œ[â€˜Of course not!â€™].â€ We come to find out that JosÃ¨phe is the madam of a brothel, so perhaps this testy response intimates that the slave woman is not in the habit of keeping company with prostitutes. There is a gap evident here between the womanâ€™s spoken words and the translation given that may more accurately depict the subtext than the dialogue itself. This distortion seems like a kind of synecdochal representation of what the games themselves do, in offering a version of history that is not wholly accurate and in creating moments that may divide the gamership into those who spot the strangeness of the narrative and those who cannot, much the way the hacker Erudito reveals certain elements only to the gamer who can catch Citizen E in <em>Liberation</em>.</p>

<span class="caption">Video 3. This credit sequence and early segment from *Freedom Cry* illustrates the gameâ€™s use of language. Subtitles here caption the language in the cutscenes, with English translations of French, Trinidadian Creole, and Haitian Kreyole provided in parentheses. Note that in the gameplay (for example, when the protagonist chases down and kills the overseer), language is not translated or transliterated.</span>
    
</div>

<p>The significance of the gameâ€™s use of unidentified, untranslated language is suggested to me by the inclusion, early on in the game, of a password in a critical scene between AdewalÃ© and Bastienne JosÃ¨phe. The latter turns out to be a wealthy and influential businesswoman with connections to both the leader of the maroon renegades and to the colonial governor. At the start of the game, JosÃ¨pheâ€™s presumed connection to the Templars causes AdewalÃ© to distrust her, and he withholds the package he had planned to deliver. JosÃ¨phe is also wary of AdewalÃ©, and so on first meeting him, she gives him a task to prove his trustworthiness. JosÃ¨phe teaches AdewalÃ© to sing a snippet of song to the field slaves as a passcode to gain access and information as he makes his way to the maroon hideout. The song is a line from a traditional Haitian lullaby, â€œSiÂ vlÃ© paÂ dodo crab la vaÂ manger,â€ which roughly translates to â€œIf you donâ€™t go to sleep, the crab will eat you.â€ While it is true that recognizing that the song is a lullaby and knowing what it means do not necessarily further oneâ€™s understanding of the game, the songâ€™s inclusion here suggests that the use of language in the game acts similarly to a kind of shibboleth, holding some gamers at bay and admitting others.</p>

<span class="caption">Figure 4. Screenshot of a cutscene from *Freedom Cry*, in which AdewalÃ© converses with Bastienne JosÃ¨phe.</span>
    
</div>

<p>There are other instances in which the use of Kreyol explicitly divides the gamership into those who can understand the true meaning of certain exchanges and those who cannot. There are two separate occasions in which a freed slave and Madame JosÃ¨phe refer to AdewalÃ© as <em>Blanc</em>, the Haitian word for stranger, which translates literally to â€œwhite person.â€ Although the gamer who reads the translation provided (if captions are enabled) may understand that this indicates that the characters do not fully trust AdewalÃ©, he or she would likely miss the irony of their referring to the black AdewalÃ© as <em>white</em> and all that this term implies in reference to the cultureâ€™s sense of community, since it is a word freighted with history.</p>

<p>Playing further on the polysemy of language, when AdewalÃ© first meets the maroon Augustin, he almost seems to speak in traditional Haitian aphorisms, saying things like â€œTo give little is not cheapâ€ (in Kreyol, â€œBay piti pa chichâ€) and â€œWhite people say without doing; the good Lord does without sayingâ€ (â€œBlanc di san fe. Bondye fe san diâ€). As a means of telling AdewalÃ© to be patient, for example, Augustin says, â€œLittle by little the bird builds its nest.â€<sup id="fnref:31" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote">30</a></sup> This type of code talking may thrill the Haitian gamer, who recognizes her or his own culture represented in the game. Games journalist Evan Narcisse, for example, writes of the pleasure of playing <em>Freedom Cry</em>, a game that feels as if it was meant for him and in which he recognizes his motherâ€™s culture.<sup id="fnref:32" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote">31</a></sup> I nevertheless believe that it might be productive for gamers of non-Caribbean descent to feel explicitly excluded in encountering undecipherable moments in the game. For my part, there were times at which I could not tell if what I was hearing was French, French spoken with a highly African accent, modern Kreyol, or an older Creole.<sup id="fnref:33" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote">32</a></sup> For one scene in particular, in the maroon hideout, I enlisted the help of other French speakers and of native Kreyol-speaking Haitians and was unable to get any consensus on which language or languages were being spoken in the passages in question. Perhaps few gamers would be bothered by this opacity, but my own experience suggested that, in some capacity, the game was holding me at armâ€™s length, reminding me of my own powerlessness within the digital system. This dynamic is, of course, a part of every videogame-playing experience. It is felt whenever a player fails to advance to the next level, is killed, or â€œdesynchronizedâ€ and must begin again. And though untranslated language appears in diverse videogames, when the content is historical slave revolt, such formal devices act as a productive partition that calls to mind the broader semiotics of slave resistance, like a lamp in a window, the monkey-wrench quilt, a song about a drinking gourdâ€”symbols to some but not legible by all.<sup id="fnref:34" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote">33</a></sup> As such, moments like these may act like the statue to the maroon slave that stands in downtown Port-au-Prince.</p>

<p>The lone figure is depicted blowing the conch, the secret call to arms, one that the viewer, of course, cannot hear in this form. As such, it emphasizes the historical rebel slaveâ€™s need to talk of revolution in ways that would allow only her or his compatriots to hear the message and that would not raise the alarm of the white colonial masters or others unsupportive of the cause. Though anyone might see the statue, the silence of the medium emphasizes that this is not an icon that belongs to everyone. It is perhaps tempting to read games such as <em>Liberation</em> and <em>Freedom Cry</em> as little more than a bit of easy shoot-â€™em-up entertainmentâ€”a genre which is always on the hunt for a way to make human victims of the protagonistâ€™s wrath unsympathetic (for example, as Nazis, or as zombies, or as Nazi zombies). And it is perhaps in this spirit that my students, who have encountered the history of Caribbean slave resistance only in this form, consume these entertainment commodities. But I have tried to show here that while the game series might seem to appropriate historical slave resistance by inviting the gamer to inhabit the role of the rebel emancipating slaves, it also defies the gamerâ€™s complete absorption in that narrative. Through the gameâ€™s optics and in the use of untranslated language, an impassable boundary is established, reminding us that the game is only a game. Like the lullaby that warns the sleepy child of the hungry crab, these devices ensure that historical slave resistance cannot be devoured entirely, despite the consumable nature of these entertainment commodities. Therefore, even as (and perhaps, <em>because</em>) these games misrepresent history (as in the case of Makandal), they tacitly preserve a distinction between history and play: even with a game controller in hand, the history of slave resistance remains out of reach.</p>

      <p>I am currently working on a book project that will address more fully the range of games in which slave resistance is rendered playable. Some are mainstream entertainment games like those described here, but there are also art games and educational games aimed at elementary school children that depict runaway slaves, which I include in my study. See, for example, the art game <em>Thralled</em>, a side-scrolling puzzle game about a runaway slave, created by students at the USC Games Lab, and <em>Mission US: Flight to Freedom</em>, an educational game about the Underground Railroad. I argued in â€œKill the Overseer! Playing the Rebel Slave in Videogames,â€ a recent talk given at the Experimental Media and Performing Arts Center, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, on 1 February 2017, that both these games use emotional stress (the persistent sound of a crying baby in the first, the demand to click through a series of chores before the overseer metes out punishment in the second) to heighten the playerâ€™s experience, fostering empathy for the playable character as a representative of historical slave resistance.

      <p>Discussions of empathy are often a major component of narratives about slavery and slave revolt, dating back to the sentimentalist tradition of both Harriet Beecher Stoweâ€™s <em>Uncle Tomâ€™s Cabin</em> and her <em>Dred</em>, which T.

In his review, Narcisse makes several good points about the game: its deft avoidance of Vodou, a topic that is too often used to ignorantly demonize the culture (and as I have already indicated, used to mixed effect in <em>Liberation</em>), and its significant use of Haitian music.Â <a href="#fnref:32" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>
