I"¸<p>Two of our articles in this issue lead with an epigraph by singular
Trinidadian thinker C. L. R. James. Nick Nesbitt evokes the James who
points to revolution in the control of modes of production, and Marisa
Parham conjures the James who calls for revolution in the form of
‚Äúspeculative thought.‚Äù These two conceptual bookends capture well what
the overall project of <em>archipelagos</em> has strived to be. As David Scott
wrote in his introduction to our first issue, ‚ÄúThe Caribbean won‚Äôt stand
still.‚Äù In our role as editors of this platform, we have tried to
embrace that inherent reality‚Äîto gather and care for work that honors
the ever-changing intellectual shorelines of our Caribbean and its
study. In doing so, we have been open to experimentation and innovation,
letting go of our material and formal assumptions as editors and
producers. That said, innovation, in its mainstream guise, is a notion
that calls for a measure of caution, too. The idea that whatever is
bright, shiny, and new is somehow better than‚Äîor a replacement
for‚Äîwhat‚Äôs come before is unhelpful. Innovation for innovation‚Äôs sake
risks wasting valuable resources and hiding labor; it risks distracting
from the substance of the work and its maintenance. And so we‚Äôve tried
also to make sure that what we propose are deeply considered
<em>interventions</em>‚Äîthoughtful forays into the digital and machinic new that
remain mindful of the material and personal realities from which that
new has emerged.</p>

<p>We feel confident that our third issue of <em>archipelagos</em> strikes that
balance, and this in large part is thanks to our collaboration with
Jessica Marie Johnson. Well aware of Johnson‚Äôs commitment to both rigor
and inventiveness in her scholarly praxis, we readily left our baby in
her hands in putting together this issue. We were certain that her
proposed special section, ‚ÄúSlavery in the Machine,‚Äù would bring the
inquiries of our prior two issues into provocative new spaces‚Äîboth in
the breadth of the content she envisioned and in the technological
fluency that undergirds her imagination. In step with Johnson‚Äôs vision,
we have pushed ourselves to reconsider genre boundaries and to
experiment‚Äîdare we say, to innovate‚Äîin our methods of production. We
leapt at the chance to work with her, seeing this as the first of many
collaborations we hope to sustain with fellow pioneers and supporters of
the Caribbean digital. Indeed, we built this space so that scholars like
her would come.</p>

<p>Not only does the first section offer finely considered theoretical
explorations of the machine as metaphor along with reflections on the
infinitely diverse multimedia spaces of digital storytelling, but
Johnson has also brought to <em>archipelagos</em> our first truly multivalent
hybrid of an intervention‚Äîa generative enactment of the glitch that
explodes our habits of reading online and lays bare the ways these
habits are overdetermined by machines all-too-often outside our control.
The issue‚Äôs second section reviews a platform that asks explicitly how
careful markup and interface can be deployed to trouble old stories.
This section further explores the ways and the stakes of storytelling
otherwise via its inclusion of a ‚Äúreporting in‚Äù from the creators of a
digital project we featured in our inaugural issue. Both these platforms
illustrate with gratifying clarity how creative use of network
technology can serve humanistic inquiry. In this regard, they evince
precisely the kind of work and the standards of praxis we have laid out
for ourselves in developing <em>archipelagos</em>.</p>

<p>We hope that, like us, you will see this gathering of digital
reflections and praxes as participating in the project of (re)shaping
expectations around ways of being and knowing in the academy from the
<em>specific</em> space of our Americas. Welcome, then, to our grounded and
innovative‚Äîour past-, present-, and future-looking‚Äîthird issue of <em>sx</em>
<em>archipelagos</em>.</p>

<p>Onward,<br />
