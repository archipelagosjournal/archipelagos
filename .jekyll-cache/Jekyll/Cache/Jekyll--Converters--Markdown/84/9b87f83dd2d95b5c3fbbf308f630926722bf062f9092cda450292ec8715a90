I"»Œ<p>In Havana on the night of 14 March 1812, three free men of color left
the capital city for the countryside. One of the men wore a uniform,
blue with gold buttons with eagles on them. He spoke French and went by
the name Jean-Fran√ßois, general of the Haitian Revolution, even though
the real Jean-Fran√ßois had died in Spain a few years earlier. It was
harvest season, and the men were heading to sugar plantations to begin a
revolution against slavery. When they arrived at the estate called Pe√±as
Altas, they gathered the slaves. Jean-Fran√ßois read in French from
papers he insisted were his king‚Äôs orders for the liberation of Cuba‚Äôs
slaves. (In fact, the papers included an advertisement for William Young
Birch, publisher and stationer in Philadelphia.) He told them that he
was there on orders of his king to lead them in revolution. Together
they burned buildings and sugar cane and killed a few whites. But at the
third plantation, the rebels were defeated and captured.</p>

<p>As authorities questioned these three men and others, they learned the
outlines of an ambitious plot. In the capital, the rebels had planned to
launch separate attacks on the city‚Äôs fortresses and armories, seizing
weapons with which to arm hundreds of recruits they said were awaiting
the signal to rise up. One of the leaders had dictated a public
proclamation and nailed it to a side door of the governor‚Äôs palace. They
had flags and standards ready to post at the camps they planned to
establish. Their networks stretched from plantations to the heart of the
capital city and, according to some contemporary accounts, as far east
as Santiago. And all this labor and planning was directed to one clear
goal: freedom for the enslaved.</p>

<p>In all the investigation into the conspiracy, one name appeared over and
over: Jos√© Antonio Aponte. Aponte was a free black man, born in Havana
sometime around 1760. He was a veteran of Spain‚Äôs free black militia in
Havana, where his grandfather and father had also served. His
grandfather had defended the city against the British siege of 1762.
Aponte himself participated in the capture of The Bahamas from the
British during the American Revolution. Aponte was also a carpenter,
with a workshop at the Plaza del Cristo, just inside the city wall. He
made cabinets and carved fine religious statues for the city‚Äôs churches.
His carving of Jes√∫s Peregrino (Jesus Pilgrim), which he placed over the
door to the house where he lived with his wife and children, was so
impressive that his street came to be known by the same name.</p>

<p>Aponte‚Äôs home and workshop were both popular places for black militia
members to visit. Sometimes they came by to borrow books or to lend
them. Aponte liked to draw. When he heard of an image arriving in
Havana‚Äîfor example, of Haitian revolutionary hero Jean Fran√ßois‚Äîhe would
head to the docks to purchase or borrow it. Then he would copy the image
and lend his copy to others. Sometimes people would come visit just to
see his drawings of such figures. Aponte also collected images. He owned
one, for example, of George Washington; he had others related to the
French Revolution and the Haitian Revolution and to Spanish kings and
saints. In his house, he had a library of more than a dozen books: the
third volume of <em>Don Quijote</em>, guides to Havana and Rome, histories of
Ethiopia published in seventeenth-century Spain, grammar handbooks, art
manuals, compendiums of the history of the world.</p>

<p>And hidden deep inside a trunk full of clothes was a pine box with a
sliding top, and inside this smaller box was another book, one created
by Aponte himself‚Äîhis so-called <em>libro de pinturas</em>, or book of
paintings. When authorities discovered the book during their
investigation into the conspiracy, they likely figured they had their
man. One of the first images they would have found in the book, located
at pages 6 and 7, seemed to portray a battle scene between a black army
and a white one. What is more, the black army appeared to be defeating
the white one. In one corner of the picture were two black soldiers on
horseback, each brandishing a white head covered in blood. Immediately
convinced of Aponte‚Äôs subversion, authorities confiscated the book and
then arrested its creator.</p>

<p>As the investigation continued, authorities pored over Aponte‚Äôs book.
Like the other items confiscated from his house, the book‚Äôs contents
were a confounding mix of materials and images‚Äîhand-drawn pictures and
maps, scenes or words cut from fans and prints and pasted onto the
pages. Represented was a diverse array of subject matter: Greek
goddesses and black saints; popes and kings in Rome, Ethiopia, and
Spain; distant and local armies; Havana and the heavens. Authorities
also soon learned that Aponte had shown the book to his coconspirators,
explaining some of its images as a way to help prepare for the coming
revolution. He had shown one companion the fascinating and complex
‚Äúself-portrait‚Äù on pages 24 and 25, supposedly to help picture himself
as leader of a new order without slavery; he had shown them pictures of
the camps of the black militias that had protected Havana against the
British in 1762 to illustrate how their own rebel camps should be
organized. Though Aponte had most likely started working on his book
around 1806‚Äì7, by 1812, when he shared it with others plotting
revolution, he drew sometimes explicit links between his artistic
creation and his political movement. He showed them his battle scenes to
illustrate how they should organize their own fight against slavery in
Havana. He pointed out pictures of powerful black men and of himself as
would-be king as a way of illustrating that other worlds were possible.
To explain and imagine revolution and its object, the book was
instrumental.</p>

<p>For Spanish and slaveholding authorities, the book was instrumental in
another way: it helped seal the fate of its creator. Just a few weeks
after the discovery of the book, Aponte was condemned to death. On 9
April 1812, he was hanged in public, his head severed from his body and
placed on a pike, which was then placed inside a cage strategically
erected at an important crossroads in the city, very close to Aponte‚Äôs
own home. Then, sometime after the execution, the book disappeared. So
for this revolution that never quite was, perhaps the most important
source is a book that no modern scholar has ever seen.</p>

<p>Aponte scholars, of course, have looked for it.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> Historian Matt Childs,
for example, uncovered the fact that the Spanish governor of Cuba, who
had ordered Aponte‚Äôs execution, asked to personally view some of the
material from the trial on the evening before his return to Spain (just
days after Aponte‚Äôs execution).<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> Following that lead, Ada Ferrer
sought the book in the papers of that governor‚Äôs family, held in the
<a href="https://www.mecd.gob.es/ca/cultura/areas/archivos/mc/archivos/nhn/portada.html">Archivo Hist√≥rico de la
Nobleza</a>
in Toledo, Spain. Taking seriously Aponte‚Äôs claim to have created the
book as a gift for the king of Spain, Ferrer searched in a section of
the <a href="https://www.patrimonionacional.es/colecciones-reales/archivo-general-de-palacio">Royal Palace
Archives</a>
called Locos y An√≥nimos, which houses letters and gifts to the Crown
made by unknown or ‚Äúinsignificant‚Äù people.</p>

<p>For the most part, these were old-fashioned analog searches that led to
many interesting things but never to the book. Yet the book‚Äôs absence
has not deterred scholars. Instead, they (we) have reveled in analyzing
this important missing artifact, learning to work around and even to
love its absence.</p>

<h2 id="apontes-archive">Aponte‚Äôs Archive</h2>

<p>Without the book, scholars have relied on another fascinating historical
document: the transcript of the part of Aponte‚Äôs trial devoted to his
book of paintings. Aponte‚Äôs descriptions of his work come to us through
this complex, layered archival document. The layers of the archival
record register the agency of the colonial state and Aponte himself. A
colonial notary recorded Aponte‚Äôs words. As Kathryn Burns reminds us,
notaries ‚Äúgave records their words and final form‚Äù‚Äî making myriad
decisions about how to edit the archival record.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> In addition to the
decisions of the notary, we encounter the decisions of the judicial
officials questioning Aponte as to the contents of his book of
paintings. They viewed the book with suspicion, and they asked Aponte
more questions about certain images than others. As a result, the
archival document records more extensive descriptions of a page such as
<em>l√°mina</em> 37, with its many important black religious officials in Rome,
than of later l√°minas with their very brief descriptions. Finally,
Aponte also shaped the archival record. He decided how much information
to share, and he did so while on trial for his life. In fact, Aponte may
have created some images to be deliberately ambiguous, and he described
the images, at times, in ways that evidence this ambiguity.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p>The fragments of Aponte‚Äôs testimony, read through these layers, often
appear as frustrating glimpses into the book, never quite complete. Yet
as the powerful work of scholars of slavery demonstrates, grappling with
the ‚Äúimpossibility of recovery‚Äù necessitates the improvisation of new
historical methods.<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">5</a></sup> Engaging with fragments and silences forces us
to see the archive as ‚Äúhome to the counter-narrative, or at least to its
possibility.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote">6</a></sup></p>

<p>For instance, Ferrer‚Äôs <em>Freedom‚Äôs Mirror</em> pursues one method of working
within the archive to probe meanings in the book‚Äôs absent presence.
Using the court testimony, Ferrer compares the way Aponte described
particular image to authorities and the way he described those same
images to his coconspirators. Through that kind of comparison we learn,
for instance, that picture 37, which Aponte described to officials as
depicting important black religious men in Rome, may also (or instead)
have represented Henri Christophe (which is what Aponte had told one of
his coconspirators). Using other archival sources, Ferrer explores what
some of the elements that appeared in the book might have meant to
Aponte and to his companions. The enigmatic picture numbered 8‚Äì9, which
Aponte referred to as an allegory about greed and commerce, depicted the
planet Mercury of Gemini in a carriage pulled by two large rapacious
birds. There was a green star and a <em>caduceo</em>, a staff signifying the
progress of commerce. Also pictured was a guard attempting to stop
contraband, who encountered death. A launch from the ship approached;
avarice jumped on the dock and also encountered death. In passing,
Aponte mentions the name of the ship, the <em>San Lorenzo</em>. Mining other
sources, we learn that the <em>San Lorenzo</em> had transported black generals
from the Haitian Revolution to Havana in 1795, had participated in the
victorious Spanish siege of Bayaj√°, and was the ship on which at least
two of Aponte‚Äôs coconspirators had served as militiamen. Here, then, may
have been a trace of an alternative allegory. Aponte‚Äôs testimony to
authorities rendered the ship element of the drawing faint and elusive,
buried, like so many of his images, not just by the subsequent loss of
the book but also by Aponte himself, by his strategic evasions and
deflections, by the disavowals he himself was forced to effect in the
courtroom.</p>

<p>This particular portrait is but one example of many, for other pictures
as well undoubtedly contained elements that would have been obscure to
authorities but that evoked different histories, memories, and resources
for the conspirators. Thus the glorious black history pictured in
Aponte‚Äôs book and so visible to the eyes of all who saw it‚Äîof black
kings and cardinals and generals and emperors of Ethiopia and Egypt‚Äîwas
accompanied by another black history, more subterranean yet equally
subversive.</p>

<p>The process of identifying and tracking all such potential connections,
however, seems almost interminable. Some potential leads become dead
ends; others lead to dozens of other possible paths. The book‚Äîor rather
the description of the book in the trial testimony‚Äîis so dense and so
wide ranging in its references that it is impossible for any one person
to pick up its many layers of references and allusions. It would take
someone deeply familiar with Cuban history, and Spanish; with Greek and
Roman history and mythology; with astronomy; with Afro-Cuban religion
and freemasonry and the Bible; with early modern writing on Egypt and
Ethiopia; with conventions of artistic practice in Aponte‚Äôs time, and so
on. Indeed, the person capable of following‚Äîmuch less understanding‚Äîthe
many intricate, contradictory references in Aponte‚Äôs testimony likely
does not exist.</p>

<p>Aponte and his story, put simply, are too big for one scholar or one
method. Instead, Aponte invites a vast, new kind of collaboration in
which many different people across many different fields and specialties
can read Aponte‚Äôs description of the book together, each potentially
building on the other, each potentially taking another‚Äôs interpretation
in a new direction. All this without forgetting the concrete social
world in which Aponte lived and created.</p>

<p>Here, the digital humanities‚Äîby fostering both critical methodological
innovation and interdisciplinary collaboration‚Äîare especially promising.
They provide frameworks for opening up the archive and engaging with the
imperfect record available to us, reframing ‚Äúthe archive itself as a
site of action rather than as a record of fixity of loss.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote">7</a></sup> For
curating our <a href="http://aponte.hosting.nyu.edu/"><em>Digital Aponte</em></a> project
(see fig. 1), transforming Aponte‚Äôs descriptions into a site of action
meant first making that archival record as accessible as possible.<sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote">8</a></sup></p>

<!-- _includes/image.html -->

<p><em>Digital Aponte</em> aspires to foreground Aponte‚Äôs words, through the
archival document, as they have arrived to us. Our effort may be
‚Äúpredicated on impossibility,‚Äù<sup id="fnref:9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote">9</a></sup> but it aims to provide a platform for
the kind of innovative methodology and collaboration that Aponte and his
story require and deserve. First, under the tab labeled ‚ÄúBook of
Paintings,‚Äù we introduce the archival document (‚Äú<a href="http://aponte.hosting.nyu.edu/transcript/">Trial
Transcript</a>‚Äù) by explaining
the circumstances of its production before presenting Aponte‚Äôs actual
descriptions of his book
(‚Äú<a href="http://aponte.hosting.nyu.edu/book-of-paintings/">L√°minas</a>‚Äù).</p>

<p>Opening up the archive and attending to Aponte‚Äôs world also meant
putting the archival record in conversation with Aponte as an
intellectual and artist. We wanted to engage with the possible
influences that contributed to his development as a thinker and creator,
ultimately leading to the production of the book of paintings. In this
way, the archive inspired us to design the website so it also becomes a
tool to communicate our ‚Äúsense of history‚Äôs possibilities.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:10" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote">10</a></sup> The
digital allows for this capaciousness. We can present to the site viewer
these aspects of Aponte all at once, individually, or sequentially. The
historian and digital humanist Jessica Marie Johnson observes that this
is the ‚Äúnature of a form that is chimeric, elusive, and eerily
transparent at the same time‚Äîdigital and social media cannot be read
forward or back as if it were chapters in a book.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:11" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote">11</a></sup> The design of
the website presents the viewer with the ability to choose the order in
which they engage with Aponte‚Äôs work of art and his ostensible formative
influences. The viewer may choose to contemplate a recreation of
Aponte‚Äôs library (‚Äú<a href="http://aponte.hosting.nyu.edu/apontes-library/">Aponte‚Äôs
Library</a>‚Äù), which
consisted of a dozen volumes across a wide range of topics. Sometimes,
when interrogators asked Aponte how he knew about a story he depicted in
his book, he responded by citing a volume in his collection. By making
Aponte‚Äôs library accessible on the website, viewers can consider the
written (and possibly illustrated) works that influenced Aponte‚Äôs
intellectual formation and contributed to the construction of the book
of paintings. Site users may also consider the visual culture of
Aponte‚Äôs time, through an image gallery (‚Äú<a href="http://aponte.hosting.nyu.edu/havana-visual-culture/">Image
Gallery</a>‚Äù), and
the possible sources of inspiration for both the content and form of his
illustrations in the book of paintings. Lastly, a map of Havana
(‚Äú<a href="http://aponte.hosting.nyu.edu/apontes-havana/">Aponte‚Äôs Havana</a>‚Äù)
plots sites relevant to Aponte‚Äôs life and also locations he represented
in his book, providing the basis for the contemplation of Aponte‚Äôs own
experience of Havana. <em>Digital Aponte</em> presents different <em>caminos</em>
(paths) to knowing Aponte and his work of art, echoing the different
caminos that Cuban <em>orichas</em> (deities) follow upon consecration.</p>

<h2 id="the-book-the-trial-and-collaborative-interpretation">The Book, the Trial, and Collaborative Interpretation</h2>

<p>The ‚Äú<a href="http://aponte.hosting.nyu.edu/book-of-paintings/">Book of
Paintings</a>‚Äù page
introduces the contents of Aponte‚Äôs book through a table that provides a
link to each numbered image, describes the contents of that image, and
indicates whether annotations are available. The table allows for the
visitor either to read the contents of each page before deciding where
to begin reading the book or to simply go directly to a page and start
exploring. We wanted to create micro and macro ways to engage, so to
speak, with the book. When the viewer clicks on a particular page of the
book, she encounters the original Spanish text of the archival document
on the left and, if applicable, an annotation sidebar (‚ÄúCommentary‚Äù) on
the right. Longer annotations can be expanded via a ‚ÄúRead More‚Äù link and
collapsed via a ‚ÄúRead Less‚Äù link.</p>

<p>The collection of annotations of Aponte‚Äôs trial record is the part of
the website that, we hope, will be most dynamic. Presently, the
annotations included are from already existing scholarship on Aponte.
Our goal is to replace those with annotations written specifically for
the website by those same scholars. Annotations written for the project
could be shorter and more streamlined than the ones excerpted from
published works. Also, scholars could respond to each other‚Äôs
annotations‚Äîperhaps suggesting differing interpretations or adding new
elements‚Äîin ways more dynamic than the current, more static excerpts.
Ultimately, however, our goal is to open up the annotation process
beyond the relatively small circle of Aponte scholars whose work is
already represented on the site. We hope to invite contributions from
scholars working in fields that Aponte‚Äôs art engages‚Äîclassicists, or
students of early modern Ethiopia, for example. There is significant
speculation about Aponte‚Äôs possible involvement with freemasonry and
about his possible priestly role in Santer√≠a. Scholars (or leading
practitioners) of either might provide insightful and novel commentary
on Aponte‚Äôs use of symbols and stories. For now, however, this
ambitious, collaborative process of annotations remains in very early
planning stages.<sup id="fnref:12" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote">12</a></sup></p>

<p>The idea of making <em>Digital Aponte</em>‚Äôs annotated and annotatable version
of Aponte‚Äôs trial testimony an exercise in modest crowdsourcing mirrors
the ways Aponte‚Äôs book of paintings was itself the product of
collaboration and exchange. Aponte famously used the artistic practice
of collage, fully a hundred years before the date art historians
generally identify as its origin. Collage might itself be understood as
a method that allows the creator literally to use the work of others.
Aponte testified that ‚Äúnot being a painter, he bought different prints
and paintings to take from them, or from used fans, that which fulfilled
his idea.‚Äù As Linda Rodr√≠guez has noted, Aponte repurposed others‚Äô
images, using them to create his own meaning.<sup id="fnref:13" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote">13</a></sup> Similarly, because he
had less confidence in his drawing and painting skills, he sometimes had
the apprentices in his carpentry workshop paint parts of some
l√°minas‚Äîfor example, 37 and 46‚Äîto incorporate into his book of
paintings. Even some of the ideas for the images arose from social
interactions‚Äîfor example, informative conversations with other Havana
denizens about the existence of black priests in Rome, or readings about
San Antonio Abad in books shared among local free people of color.
Aponte‚Äôs book was his, but it was also a product of complex
intellectual, social, political, and cultural interactions and
collaborations. <em>Digital Aponte</em>‚Äôs collaborative annotation of the trial
transcripts promises to mirror that very practice.</p>

<p>Not only was the subject matter in Aponte‚Äôs book wide ranging, even
individual l√°minas were. Each often combined elements from different
repertoires in unexpected and original ways. So, too, must analysis of
the book reflect that expansiveness and, for lack of a better word,
syncretism. The annotation tool on the site has the potential to
incorporate the insights of people in disparate fields, scholars with
expertise in areas that can help shed light on Aponte‚Äôs art and
worldview. Because the book is full of classical references, for
instance, classicists might have important things to contribute to an
analysis of the book: insights into the meaning of classical symbols,
say, or an ability to recognize when Aponte‚Äôs use of those symbols
diverges from a more customary invocation. Yet a classicist may be less
familiar with how classical references might have operated in
nineteenth-century Caribbean slave societies. Like Aponte cutting out
images for his own purpose, we can reinterpret or reuse elements from
other fields and genres to elucidate Aponte‚Äôs world.</p>

<p>To illustrate how we might develop and apply this method, we turn to
Aponte‚Äôs description of his l√°mina 26. Aponte there depicts the Greek
philosopher Diogenes inside a barrel on a desolate beach, enjoying the
protection of the Egyptian goddess Isis. The Spanish Visigothic ruler
King Rodrigo orders Diogenes out of the barrel. Then, taking two fistfuls
of dirt from the barrel, the philosopher fashions the Spanish coat of
arms and the flag of Spain. That kind of magic was not in the
philosopher‚Äôs purview, but he was able to do it, Aponte said, because of
the guidance and protection of Isis.</p>

<p>A classicist interpreting that image might help us understand some of
the possible meanings of Isis, the Egyptian goddess who was incorporated
into Greco-Roman pantheons. A classicist might elaborate on Isis‚Äôs
customary association with the protection of the dead and with magical
powers (which Aponte himself refers to in his testimony). A classicist
would know that Isis appears in art usually as a column-like woman and
could provide visual clues about what Aponte might have drawn. But that
same classicist may not know about the association of Isis with Yemay√°,
one of the seven orichas in Afro-Cuban religion.</p>

<p>At the same time, a classicist familiar with the range of
representations of Isis might immediately note that the pairing of Greek
philosopher Diogenes with Isis seems idiosyncratic, outside the
customary repertoire of classical invocations. The observation draws our
attention to the link Aponte establishes between the two unlikely
allies‚Äîthe magic of Isis allows Diogenes to do magical things. What
might that link signify? Here, Diogenes becomes more than Cynic
philosopher. Diogenes, importantly, was a man formerly enslaved; in
fact, early radical abolitionists, such as Benjamin Lay, used his figure
to elicit and promote antislavery meanings.<sup id="fnref:14" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote">14</a></sup> Aponte visualizes
Diogenes as receiving the assistance of the powerful Isis, putting
divine power on the side of liberation. The result of this kind of
analysis is a black intellectual history that is profoundly
collaborative and that engages subfields of intellectual history often
artificially distant from the study of the black Atlantic.<sup id="fnref:15" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote">15</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="apontes-social-worlds-in-digital-form">Aponte‚Äôs Social Worlds in Digital Form</h2>

<p>As Aponte‚Äôs testimony necessarily forces us out of our comfort zone and
into Greek philosophy or Egyptian religion or medieval Spain, it also
repeatedly brings us back to the port city of Havana in the Age of
Revolution. How, we ask, did Aponte learn about the things he depicted
in his book of paintings?</p>

<p><em>Digital Aponte</em> provides part of the answer in the section on Aponte‚Äôs
library. The recreation of the library foregrounds Aponte‚Äôs possible
intellectual influences. A brief introduction outlines possible
connections between his library books and themes in the book of
paintings. On the website, images of the library books sit on a
bookshelf to reinforce the notion that Aponte perhaps kept his books in
a similar fashion and to call to mind the physical space of his home
and workshop. Clicking on a book‚Äôs spine takes the viewer to a page
dedicated to that particular book. Each of these pages contains
commentary from scholars about how they identified the particular
version of each book as the one Aponte likely owned, along with an image
of the cover page and a link to a Google Books copy, if available. The
recreation of Aponte‚Äôs library also encourages contending with how
communities of free people of color in the Atlantic world accessed and
shared books.</p>

<p>But understanding Aponte‚Äôs conceptual world requires that we go beyond
his library. Aponte‚Äôs book of paintings was a visual artifact, one we
cannot see. <em>Digital Aponte</em> recreates the visual worlds with which
Aponte engaged. The image gallery includes an overview of visual culture
of turn-of-the-nineteenth-century Havana along with a sampling of
images. The image gallery proceeds from the premise of a serious
consideration of Aponte as artist. What were his possible visual
influences in Havana? How did he respond to the architecture and art
that surrounded him? Some of the images represent buildings he depicted
in his book, for instance, helping us to visualize aspects of a work
inaccessible to us. Other images depict art or architecture he may have
seen in his daily life. Each thumbnail in the image gallery links to a
separate page with contextual information. Positing Aponte‚Äôs visual
influences contributes to a fuller understanding of black artistic
production. During Aponte‚Äôs lifetime, white elites sought to reclaim the
visual arts from the hands of black artists who dominated the field. As
such, black artists from the colonial period are often underanalyzed in
art histories about this era. The image gallery, in this regard,
suggests we ask, What if we wrote an art history of colonial Cuba from
the perspective of one of these artists?</p>

<p>The map section of <em>Digital Aponte</em> allows us to make Aponte‚Äôs world
more concrete. The communication‚Äîthe transfer of knowledge, ideas,
aspirations, feelings‚Äîthat underwrote Aponte‚Äôs movement was embedded in
the physical city. By pointing out the places that were part of his own
routines‚Äîhis workshop, his home, the barracks where he had trained, and
so on‚Äîand by pointing out the places that appeared in his book of
paintings, the user gets a sense of the physical distance between sites
important to Aponte and between those sites and critical spaces of
exchange and dialogue (markets and docks, for instance). We glimpse, in
other words, the literal paths Aponte walked. Ultimately, this section
of the website might serve as a template for a walking tour of Aponte‚Äôs
Havana. Such a walking tour would help not only to preserve Aponte‚Äôs
memory but to open spaces (and paths) for more critical historical
narratives and even perhaps for other kinds of tourism, as is being
pioneered in Brazil with the <a href="http://passadospresentes.com.br/site/Site/index.php"><em>Pasts
Present</em></a> and
<a href="https://apublica.org/2017/07/museum-of-yesterday/"><em>Museum of
Yesterday</em></a>
projects.<sup id="fnref:16" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote">16</a></sup></p>

<p>While the map section of <em>Digital Aponte</em> currently focuses on Havana
itself, an exciting addition might be a map that includes Pe√±as Altas,
the plantation where Aponte‚Äôs coconspirators tried to launch their slave
rebellion, as well as other plantations they attacked or marched through
on the night of 14 March 1812. Including such a map would be a way to
remind users both of the significance of the conspiracy for Aponte and
his companions and of the proximity of sugar and plantation society to
the vibrant capital city of Havana. A model for a map of the areas
targeted by the rebels might be Vincent Brown‚Äôs <a href="http://revolt.axismaps.com/"><em>Slave Revolt in
Jamaica, 1760‚Äì1761: A Cartographic
Narrative</em></a>.<sup id="fnref:17" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote">17</a></sup> Finally, the fact that
the Cuban government has recently authorized the construction of a
monument to Aponte (by renown sculptor Alberto Lescay) near Pe√±as Altas
makes it important to have that space reflected on the website‚Äôs map. It
also suggests a generative synergy between the physical monument and
<em>Digital Aponte</em>, itself a kind of dynamic, interactive monument to the
memory of Aponte and his political and creative work.</p>

<p>Just as the website incorporates Aponte‚Äôs Havana, it must also, of
course, highlight Aponte the man. Currently the biography section of the
website is minimal (‚Äú<a href="http://aponte.hosting.nyu.edu/jose-antonio-aponte/">Jos√© Antonio
Aponte</a>‚Äù). One of
the obvious areas in which further research on Aponte is needed is the
genealogical. We know, for example, that his grandfather, Joaqu√≠n
Aponte, was a captain in the Batall√≥n de Morenos of Havana, Spain‚Äôs
colonial black militia in the city. Aponte‚Äôs father (like Aponte
himself) also served in that military force. But we know little about
Aponte‚Äôs mother, or why, for instance, Aponte‚Äôs second last name
(Ulabarra) is different from that of the woman (Mariana Poveda) usually
identified as his mother.<sup id="fnref:18" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote">18</a></sup> It may have been from that side of the
family that Aponte received the title to his carpentry workshop,
according to inconclusive documents in the Cuban National Archives.
Information about Aponte‚Äôs descendants is even murkier. For example, the
names of his children given on the official <a href="https://www.ecured.cu/Jos√©_Antonio_Aponte">EcuRed
page</a> (Cuba‚Äôs answer to
Wikipedia) are different from those that appear in passing in the
judicial testimony.<sup id="fnref:19" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote">19</a></sup> Fleshing out that genealogy lends itself to the
kinds of collaboration facilitated by digital platforms. Here, one
important resource is the <a href="https://www.slavesocieties.org/">Slave Societies Digital
Archive</a> directed by historian Jane
Landers at Vanderbilt.<sup id="fnref:20" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote">20</a></sup> The website houses digital copies of
ecclesiastical records (such as baptisms, deaths, marriages) in Cuba,
Brazil, and Colombia. Included among the Cuban records are those of
churches that Aponte, his family, and his coconspirators may have
attended, including Jes√∫s, Mar√≠a y Jos√© (near his home) and Santo Cristo
del Buen Viaje (near his first workshop). Indeed, the records of the
Archbishopric Archive available on the website include a
<a href="https://essss.library.vanderbilt.edu/islandora/object/essss%3A3824">petition</a>
to create a new carpenters‚Äô brotherhood. The petition was signed by
Aponte and at least one of his coconspirators.<sup id="fnref:21" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote">21</a></sup></p>

<p>How, we wonder, did Aponte‚Äôs heirs experience and remember his attempt
at revolution and his brutal execution at the hands of Spanish
authorities? Did they participate in subsequent revolutionary movements,
such as the 1839 conspiracy in Havana that implicated some other
participants from the 1812 movement or the major conspiracies of
1843‚Äì44, known soon after as La Escalera?<sup id="fnref:22" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote">22</a></sup> Did they participate in
the wars of independence against Spain in the late nineteenth century or
the protests of the Independent Party of Color in 1912?<sup id="fnref:23" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote">23</a></sup> In 1940,
when members of the Federation of the Cuban Societies of Color wrote to
the Constitutional Convention calling for a constitutional article
against discrimination, one such letter writer signed his name Jos√©
Antonio Aponte.<sup id="fnref:24" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote">24</a></sup> A descendant perhaps? Tracing Aponte‚Äôs memory and
the connections between that memory and subsequent political movements
is work that yet remains to be done.</p>

<h2 id="collaboration-as-creation-a-new-book-of-paintings">Collaboration as Creation: A New Book of Paintings</h2>

<p>In the meantime, one unintended but exciting byproduct of the website is
the creation in a different medium, register, and time of Aponte‚Äôs book
of paintings. We refer here to the contemporary art exhibit <em>Visionary
Aponte: Art and Black Freedom</em>, which opened at the Little Haiti
Cultural Center in December 2017 and traveled to New York University and
Duke University in February and September 2018, respectively. Subsequent
showings are currently being planned at other locations across the
United States as well as in Haiti, Cuba, and Guadeloupe. In the absence
of Aponte‚Äôs book, fifteen artists have used the material on <em>Digital
Aponte</em> to help them reimagine Aponte‚Äôs book for our time.</p>

<p><em>Visionary Aponte</em> represents an exciting encounter and collaboration
between art and scholarship. It is also a collaboration between artists
and scholars, mediated in part by <em>Digital Aponte</em>. Artists were charged
with engaging Aponte‚Äôs testimony about the book of paintings and using
his words about his vision as a point of departure for their own
artistic creation. As scholars, we wondered what it would be like for
the artists themselves to work on something so deeply historical and to
begin their project from the trial record‚Äôs often awkward, stilted words
about pictures that no longer exist.</p>

<p>Only a handful of artists selected one l√°mina to reimagine or recreate.
The majority read the testimony and did not (or could not?) limit
themselves to just one image; rather, they selected themes or elements
that appeared throughout and worked them into complex pieces. Some found
it impossible to limit themselves to creating a single painting or
drawing. √âdouard Duval Carri√© completed four paintings that drew on
multiple l√°minas; Jos√© Bedia created a large, monumental piece that
contains elements from perhaps a dozen l√°minas (see fig. 2). Marielle
Plaisir came up with more than fifty pieces, and Ren√©e Stout with some
nine (plus a gun).</p>

</div>

<p>In many cases, the production of the art was preceded by sustained
engagement with <em>Digital Aponte</em> or with the site‚Äôs creators. Here it
might be instructive to briefly summarize two such conversations. One
was with artist Teresita Fern√°ndez, who was particularly interested in
Aponte‚Äôs vision of (and recourse to) the cosmos. She spoke of an Aponte
drawn to the cosmos as a space of comfort, as a space that was
inherently democratic. Why? Because it was a space that could never be
colonized, she said. A place, we might add, where slavery had no place.
It was also a space that served as a kind of respite from Aponte‚Äôs
burdens as a leader of a weighty, treacherous struggle for black
freedom. Fern√°ndez‚Äôs interpretation is novel, and it derives, in part,
from her reading <em>as an artist</em> the words of Aponte <em>the artist</em> (see
fig. 3). We might even say it derives from a synergy between her own
artistic and political practice and Aponte‚Äôs.</p>

<span class="caption">Figure 3. Teresita Fern√°ndez, *Aponte*, 2017; pyrite, oil, and graphite on wood panel, 21.5 x 36 x 2 in. overall (courtesy of the artist and Lehmann Maupin, New York; photograph by Yolanda Navas).</span>
    
</div>

<p>Another such conversation occurred with Ren√©e Stout, who was
particularly interested in what Aponte might have tried to hide or
disguise in his book‚Äîboth figuratively, in the way he used and created
images and meaning, and more literally, by hiding or perhaps even
destroying his work so that authorities would not find it. And somehow
in the conversation‚Äôs back and forth, something that should have been
self-evident became crystal clear.</p>

<p>From other testimony, we know that Aponte had destroyed other images and
documents in his house before the police arrived‚Äîimages of Haitian
leaders, for example, and one related to the French Revolution. He knew
they were incriminating, and he testified that he destroyed them
sometime before his arrest. What might he have thought about his book in
this context? Did he consider it incriminating? That he did hide the
book‚Äîhe put it in a box and then hid that box at the bottom of a trunk
filled with clothes‚Äîsuggests that he knew the book would likely be seen
as subversive. Did he consider destroying it, as the investigators‚Äô
dragnet drew nearer? No. He hid it, but he did not destroy it. And as
Ren√©e and Ferrer pondered this, something simple and obvious became
vividly apparent‚ÄîAponte loved his book. He could not destroy it; he
protected it.</p>

<p>Thinking about Aponte‚Äôs love for his book is a fitting way to introduce
folks to both <em>Digital Aponte</em> and <em>Visionary Aponte</em>. Both are, we
think, labors of love. They are a living monument to Aponte‚Äînot just to
Aponte as ‚Äúa fighter for freedom‚Äù but rather, or also, to the Aponte who
loved and cherished his own work as an artist, creator, historian,
theorist. <em>Visionary Aponte</em> and <em>Digital Aponte</em> both help educate a
broader public about the book and its creator, and they help expand an
emerging transnational canon of black antislavery intellectual and
cultural production so as to make it less anglophone, say, and more
visual. And as the exhibit and website generate greater interest in
Aponte, they help expand the pool of people who understand the
significance of the book of paintings and the stakes of recovering it. A
future collaboration might even entail a collective search for the
missing book, documented on the website, though that is not yet planned.
Ultimately, then, the website can serve as more than a space for the
diffusion of Aponte‚Äôs story or for the advancement of novel
interpretations of his intellectual, artistic, and political labor. It
might also serve as a stimulus and guide for the ultimate act of
recovery: somewhere finding Aponte‚Äôs long-lost and beloved book.</p>

<p>Finding the book, however, is ultimately an improbable outcome. There is
no guarantee that the book has survived in one piece. The fact that the
book may not have had identifying information, such as Aponte‚Äôs name or
a title (‚ÄúBook of Paintings‚Äù is what authorities called it; we do not
know if Aponte gave it a name), means that, even if it survived, it may
not be identifiable by whoever happens to come across it. Even, for the
moment, imagining that the book can be found, we would still be unable
to answer many of our questions. Indeed, the artifact itself is likelier
to raise as many questions as it answers. However much we would all love
to locate the book, the ultimate act of recovery is perhaps less about
Aponte‚Äôs book itself than about what the book‚Äîand our own collective
endeavor to imagine it and its creator‚Äîrepresent: a profound fusion of
the artistic, intellectual, and political in which no one of those
reigns over the others. <em>Digital Aponte</em> tries to foreground that
quality in Aponte‚Äôs work and to model it in our own, cognizant always
that while definitive answers (like the book of paintings itself) remain
elusive, the collaborative process of seeking them out is itself part of
the project of envisioning freedom.</p>
