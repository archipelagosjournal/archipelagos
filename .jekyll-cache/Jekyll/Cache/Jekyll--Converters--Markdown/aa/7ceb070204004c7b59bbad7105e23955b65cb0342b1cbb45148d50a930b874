	<blockquote>The slaves worked on the land, and, like revolutionary peasants everywhere, they aimed at the extermination of their oppressors.

</div>

<p>In this famous passage that opens the fourth chapter of <em>The Black
Jacobins: Toussaint L‚ÄôOuverture and the San Domingo Revolution</em>, to
initiate its narration of the Haitian Revolution proper, C. L. R. James,
almost in passing, without explicitly developing its theoretical
implications but with the incisive originality that marks this famous
text from start to finish, places the lived experience of the slaves of
St. Domingue at the incipient point of the world-historical struggle of
the global proletariat to overcome the injustices of global capitalism
and to initiate a more just, communist form of social organization.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Only the year before, James, a militant Marxist-Leninist, had completed
<em>World Revolution, 1917‚Äì1936: The Rise and Fall of the Communist
International</em>, his incisive history of the Bolshevik Revolution modeled
on Leon Trotsky‚Äôs famous study.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> James stood at the time as
perhaps the leading anglophone voice of global Trotskyism. Pursuing this
engagement in even more original terms, <em>The Black Jacobins</em> is, among
its many virtues and characteristics, an early and perhaps the greatest
work of what was once called Leninist third-worldism.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>While James‚Äôs Leninist internationalism is evident throughout <em>The Black
Jacobins</em>, to the point of his famous musings on what Vladimir Lenin
might have done in Louverture‚Äôs position, in what follows I would like
to probe the meaning and implications of James‚Äôs reference in the above
passage to the slaves of St. Domingue as a ‚Äúmodern proletariat,‚Äù along
with the corresponding, unstated implication in the passage that the
system of plantation slavery production they experienced was an
incipient form of, or tending toward, modern industrial capitalism.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p>To do so, I will limit my analysis to considering whether Karl Marx‚Äôs
understanding of the concepts of <em>proletariat</em> and <em>slavery</em> in his
mature work correspond to the uses, both literal and implied, that James
makes of them in the above passage. While Marx‚Äôs conceptualizations of
the proletariat and slavery by no means constitute the final word on the
relation of slavery to capitalism, such a move is well justified, I
think, not only by James‚Äôs lifelong dedication to both political Marxism
and Marx‚Äôs theoretical critique of capitalism itself but also by the
penetrating originality and rigor of Marx‚Äôs theorization of the terms
themselves. I focus on this passage from <em>The Black Jacobins</em>, then,
because it is James‚Äôs single clearest and most direct statement of the
proletarian identity of the St. Domingue slaves. The few other passing
mentions of the ‚Äúproletariat‚Äù in the book lack the specificity of this
passage and merely equate the proletarian condition with that of the
exploited laboring classes in general, independent of their historically
specific subsumption to capital.<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">5</a></sup></p>

<p>A literal reading of the passage reveals both James‚Äôs visionary
rhetorical power of invention and a certain theoretical imprecision.
James does not claim the slaves of <em>St. Domingue</em> actually formed a
proletariat, nor that plantation slavery was industrial capitalist in
nature, but only that the situation <em>tended</em> in these directions.<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote">6</a></sup>
How or in what ways the slaves were ‚Äúcloser to a modern proletariat than
any group of workers in existence at the time,‚Äù James does not precisely
say. The key factor is stated to be the scale of groups of laborers
(‚Äúgangs of hundreds‚Äù) as well as that of the sites in which they were
grouped (‚Äúhuge sugar-factories‚Äù). The reference to factories, given the
overarching Leninist perspective of the book, clearly implies, in my
view, a vision of the sugar plantation as <em>tending toward</em> the modern
industrial factory form that Marx would analyze in <em>Capital</em>, and,
perhaps even more precisely (I will return to this key distinction
below), as an instance of the intermediate form of production that he
termed ‚Äúmanufacture.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote">7</a></sup></p>

<p>The conclusion James readily draws from these assertions‚Äîboth here and
above all in the full deployment of this argument across the book‚Äôs
mighty span‚Äîis justifiably renowned: the Haitian Revolution was not a
chaotic rebellion but ‚Äúa thoroughly prepared and organized mass
movement,‚Äù perhaps the first instance of a consciously conceived and
successfully implemented proletarian revolution, one that, like the
Bolshevik Revolution a century later, occurred not in the center of the
industrial West, as Marx and Friedrich Engels initially hoped, but at
its putatively underdeveloped periphery.</p>

<p>One might justifiably point out that with the single exception of this
key passage‚Äîwhich points forward in visionary terms to the future
developments of this argument by figures such as Eric Williams, Eugene
Genovese, and Robin Blackburn‚Äîthe notion of the slave as proletarian is
not a focus of <em>The Black Jacobins</em>.<sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote">8</a></sup> The same cannot be said,
however, of James‚Äôs <em>World Revolution</em>, in which the terms <em>proletariat</em>
and <em>proletarian</em> appear many hundreds of times. In <em>World Revolution</em>,
which was written a year before <em>The Black Jacobins</em>, James
unsurprisingly invokes on virtually every one of its five-hundred-some
pages the proletarian working class and its struggle for the
‚Äúdictatorship of the proletariat.‚Äù With a single exception, however, his
use of the term is no more enlightening (as to the precise meaning he
attributes to it) than in his subsequent history of the St. Domingue
revolution. In every other instance, of which there are some four
hundred in the book, ‚Äúproletariat‚Äù is deployed as a purely <em>political</em>
term, referring to the (working) class engaged in a militant struggle
for power against the bourgeois domination of the state and society.<sup id="fnref:9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote">9</a></sup></p>

<p>The exception to this uniformity occurs early in <em>World Revolution</em>, in
James‚Äôs initial presentation of Marxism, when he writes of the
historical division of society into classes. There, he notes that the
‚Äústruggle of economic forces for their full expansion was translated, as
always, into a political struggle, the struggle for control of the
State-power without which it is quite impossible to transform the
organisation of society.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:10" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote">10</a></sup> In this context, James continues, there
appeared ‚Äúa new class,‚Äù one that,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>suffering intolerably from the difficulties created by the chaos in
production, would be driven to seize the State-power and create the
conditions for the new Socialist society‚Ä¶. This class Marx and Engels
found in the proletariat. And as the bourgeoisie within feudal society
had been consolidated and disciplined by the direction and
organisation of wealth, in the same way the proletariat, organised in
factories by the development of the Capitalist system of production,
disciplined by the increasing discipline of large-scale Capitalist
organisation, would be forced to combine industrially and ultimately
politically by the increasing pressure upon them of the bourgeois
system of production.<sup id="fnref:11" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote">11</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here, James gives more extensive description and attention to the notion
of the proletariat, as a specific historical development of European
social class structures in the wake of the French Revolution. That said,
the basic characteristics he ascribes to the concept are virtually
identical to those of <em>The Black Jacobins.</em> The proletariat, in this
formulation, is characterized by the large-scale organization of
laborers in a factory system of production, by intensive proximity of
working conditions (‚Äúforced to combine industrially and ultimately
politically‚Äù), and by what James calls ‚Äúthe increasing pressure upon
them of the bourgeois system of production,‚Äù by which he presumably
means the demands for increases in both intensity and duration of
production (what Marx called the pressure to realize increases in
‚Äúabsolute surplus value‚Äù).<sup id="fnref:12" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote">12</a></sup></p>

<p>In light, then, of James‚Äôs politico-historical, Marxist-Leninist
deployment of the term <em>proletariat</em>, both in <em>World Revolution</em> and
<em>The Black Jacobins</em>, generally and above all in the key passage from
the latter with which I began, it seems to me fair and even compelling
to ask whether the terms of James‚Äôs presentation, both literal
(‚Äúproletariat‚Äù) and implied (plantation slavery as proto-industrial
capitalism), actually correspond to Marx‚Äôs uses of them. I believe in
each case the answer is no.<sup id="fnref:13" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote">13</a></sup></p>

<p>How did Marx define the proletariat in his mature (post-1857) writings?
His use of the word <em>proletariat</em> across the three volumes of <em>Capital</em>
can in fact be readily summarized, and in no case, except for the most
metaphorical, impressionistic sense, can it be applied to plantation
slavery. Occasionally, and also most imprecisely, Marx uses the term in
a general way to indicate the exploited working classes, as, for
example, in the following evocation of the origins of the 1830 July
Revolution in France: ‚ÄúThe learned dispute between the industrial
capitalist and the wealthy landowning idler as to how the booty pumped
out of the workers may most advantageously be divided for the purposes
of accumulation had to fall silent in the face of the July Revolution.
Shortly afterwards, the urban proletariat sounded the tocsin of
revolution at Lyons, and the rural proletariat began to set fire to
farmyards and hayricks in England.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:14" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote">14</a></sup> This is <em>proletariat</em> taken in
the sense of the working class as such, in a capacious, transhistorical
internationalism, one that would include workers of all sorts in their
common experience of exploitation, independently of the mode of
production in which they labored, whether archaic, feudal, or
capitalist.</p>

<p>This sense of the term is universally familiar in Marx and Engels‚Äôs
famous invocation in the <em>Communist Manifesto</em> to ‚ÄúProletarians of all
countries!,‚Äù in which proletarians are those who ‚Äúhave nothing to lose
but their chains.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:15" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote">15</a></sup> In this most famous early text‚Äîwritten before
Marx began with the <em>Grundrisse</em> in 1857, his critical analysis of
capitalism as social form‚Äîit is the entire worker herself, and not
merely, as in the analysis of <em>Capital</em>, her <em>labor power</em>, that is the
commodity she sells to capital. Arguably, while the purchase and
deployment of the slave as commodity falls under the compass of this
universal experience of exploitation, to enlarge the concept of
proletariat to such an extent renders it rhetorically compelling but
analytically meaningless.</p>

<p>That said, this broad, conceptually vague use of the term <em>proletariat</em>
clearly resonates with its traditional, pre-Marxian usage. Famously
derived from the Latin <em>proletarius</em>, meaning any citizen of the lowest
class in Roman society, it entered into modern usage from the sixteenth
century to refer to those who live off their manual labor, along with
the poor and indigent more generally.<sup id="fnref:16" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote">16</a></sup> The implication I am
suggesting here is that James‚Äôs use of the term <em>proletariat</em> in <em>The
Black Jacobins</em> might reasonably be thought to invoke this expansive
sense of exploitation‚Äîfrom the ultra-feudal application of direct
violence in slavery, symbolized by the master‚Äôs whip, to the invisible,
fetishized extraction of surplus value from the ‚Äúfree‚Äù wage laborer by
the capitalist‚Äîwere it not, that is, for the single adjective the
militant Marxist-Leninist places before the term: ‚ÄúThey were closer to a
<em>modern</em> proletariat than any group of workers in existence at the
time.‚Äù</p>

<p>Marx did not invent the modern notion of <em>proletarian</em> that he
immortalized in the <em>Manifesto</em> and went on to analyze in scientific
detail in <em>Capital</em>, in the sense, that is, of a wage laborer in the
employ of an industrial capitalist. Already in the 1840s, left
Ricardians and socialists such as Henri de Saint-Simon, Pierre-Joseph
Proudhon, J. C. L. Simonde de Sismondi and their lesser followers used
the term freely. Marx knew this literature intimately, and one finds
scores of citations and their scathing critique scattered across the
thousands of pages of Marx‚Äôs post-1857 writings.<sup id="fnref:17" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote">17</a></sup> However, in his
systematic analysis and critique of capitalism as a general social form
or structure, <em>Capital</em>, that is to say, Marx, developed two
analytically precise and, in fact, mutually exclusive notions of
<em>proletariat.</em><sup id="fnref:18" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote">18</a></sup> Neither, in point of fact, is in any conceivable
fashion applicable to plantation slavery understood as a specific,
historical mode of production.</p>

<p>The first is that just mentioned, that of the social class of wage
laborers employed by capital. In the final chapters of <em>Capital</em>, volume
1, Marx takes up and even cites his earlier formulation of the concept
in the <em>Manifesto</em>,<sup id="fnref:19" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote">19</a></sup> but goes on in the final chapters of volume 1
to give the term far more analytical precision than in the earlier,
polemical setting of the <em>Manifesto</em>.<sup id="fnref:20" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote">20</a></sup> In fact, in a footnote to
chapter 25 (‚ÄúThe General Law of Capitalist Accumulation‚Äù), Marx
categorically affirms this first sense to be the manner in which he
understands the concept within his systematic analysis:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúProletarian‚Äù must be understood to mean, economically speaking,
nothing other than ‚Äúwage-labourer,‚Äù the man who produces and valorizes
‚Äúcapital.‚Äù‚Ä¶‚ÄúThe sickly proletarian of the primitive forest‚Äù is a
pretty Roscherian fancy. The primitive forester is the owner of the
primitive forest and uses it as his property, meeting as few obstacles
to this as an orang-utang. He is not, therefore, a proletarian. This
would only be the case if the primitive forest exploited him, instead
of being exploited by him.<sup id="fnref:21" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote">21</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Marx is here unambiguous, and, regarding James‚Äôs own assertion, it is
clear that by this definition, the plantation slaves were no proletariat
whatsoever. There can be no question of tendency or degree by Marx‚Äôs
definition, no ‚Äúthe closest thing to‚Äù earning a wage for their labor.
Either one‚Äôs entire being is an object of possession and forced to labor
by the application of direct violence, or one earns a wage, however
derisory.</p>

<p>This unambiguous clarity is muddled, in Marx‚Äôs case, by a second, quite
distinct definition of the proletariat that he puts forward in the
famous chapter of <em>Capital</em>, ‚ÄúThe Secret of Primitive Accumulation.‚Äù
There, Marx identifies the proletarian as the person who formerly, and
by secular right, owned certain means of production and, also by right,
farmed land for her and her family‚Äôs sustenance; from these means and
rights she assured her existence and reproduction.<sup id="fnref:22" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote">22</a></sup> In the brutal
process of primitive accumulation, these means and rights are violently
stripped away, and the rightless, possessionless proletarian is cast
out, ‚Äúfree,‚Äù expelled from society: ‚ÄúThe proletariat created by the
breaking-up of the bands of feudal retainers and by the forcible
expropriation of the people from the soil, this free and rightless
proletariat could not possibly be absorbed by the nascent manufactures
as fast as it was thrown upon the world.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:23" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote">23</a></sup></p>

<p>This second definition of the term on Marx‚Äôs part evokes the original,
literal meaning of the term: the <em>pro-letarii</em>, utterly marginalized
from society, those whose only activity is to ‚Äúproduce offspring.‚Äù Marx
repeatedly, and with savage irony, describes these rightless
proletarians as <em>vogelfrei</em>, ‚Äúfree as birds‚Äù (as in the phrase, ‚ÄúSeine
Emanzipation verwandelt ihn also sofort in einen vogelfreien
Proletarier‚Äù); free, that is, as entirely outside human society,
rightless and unable to sustain themselves.<sup id="fnref:24" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote">24</a></sup> The point here, as with
the contrasting definition of the proletarian as wage laborer, is that
the plantation slave, in her juridically codified bondage, can in no
sense be considered ‚Äúfree,‚Äù even in this most ironic, legalistic sense.</p>

<p>It would instead be far more appropriate to use the term <em>proletariat</em>
in Marx‚Äôs second sense, to indicate the experience of <em>emancipated</em>
slaves in the French Caribbean, a newly ‚Äúenfranchised‚Äù community forced
to survive by whatever means available. While in the wake of the 1794
Jacobin abolition survival entailed the construction of autonomous
communes, such as that in Les Cayes, by the time of France‚Äôs second,
1848 emancipation, the increasing subsumption of Antillean society to
the demands of capitalist valorization meant that this veritable
proletarianization was experienced as forcible subjection to the
contractual demands of wage labor.<sup id="fnref:25" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote">25</a></sup></p>

<p>The historical shift between plantation slave-based and
industrial-capitalist modes of production in the eighteenth and
nineteenth centuries‚Äîfrom the categorial perspective of Marx‚Äôs
critique of political economy‚Äîneither comprised a gradual, tendential
shift from the former to the latter, nor was it a matter of the size of
manufactures and concentrations of laborers, as James implies in <em>The
Black Jacobins</em>. Instead, Marx arguably identifies three key factors
that distinguish these modes of production, factors that are binary
rather than linear.<sup id="fnref:26" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote">26</a></sup> I say arguably because Marx nowhere analyzes
this question as such, and understandably so, since the object of
<em>Capital</em> is the categorial analysis and critique of capitalism in its
ideal form; the historical problems of both of its genesis and
supersession are never addressed in more than passing detail.<sup id="fnref:27" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote">27</a></sup>
Instead, the determinant factors of these two modes of production must
be identified and collated from analyses occurring across the vast
expanse of the three volumes of <em>Capital</em>.</p>

<p>What distinguishes the various economic formations of society, the
distinction between, for example, ‚Äúa society based on slave-labour and a
society based on wage-labour,‚Äù Marx writes, ‚Äúis the form in which this
surplus labour is in each case extorted from the immediate producer, the
worker.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:28" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote">28</a></sup> On this count, the categorial distinction between the
plantation slavery and capitalist modes of production is not a matter of
degrees and tendencies. Size of manufactures, concentrations of workers,
degrees and forms of suffering and violence (the criteria James mentions
in both <em>World Revolution</em> and <em>The Black Jacobins</em>) are indeed, as
James suggests, matters of relative degree and differentiation; for the
question at hand, however, they are transhistorical, nonspecific to
capitalism, and, as such, cannot serve to constitute the distinction
between these two modes of production.</p>

<p>Marx instead identifies various other ‚Äúfactors,‚Äù such as property
rights, the source of surplus value, and the dual nature of living labor
under capitalism as productive of both use values and surplus
value.<sup id="fnref:29" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote">29</a></sup> One is either a chattel slave, the material possession of a
slave owner, or one is a contractual, ‚Äúfree‚Äù seller of her labor power
for its market value. Such a distinction is not a matter of degree, of
being, in James‚Äôs words, ‚Äúcloser to a modern proletariat,‚Äù but is rather
absolute. In conclusion, then, I shall briefly review Marx‚Äôs
understanding of the difference between plantation slavery and
capitalism, to more clearly grasp the distinction between the two‚Äîa
distinction James himself invokes only in passing.</p>

<p>Briefly‚Äîsince to adequately treat the topic of Marx and slavery would
require a book unto itself‚Äîin plantation slavery Marx reasonably
understands the slave‚Äôs entire person to be the possession or property
of the slaveholder. She is, in the infamous words of the 1685 Code Noir,
his ‚Äúmeuble.‚Äù This in fact remained legally the case in the French
colonies until 1848. The words of the slave merchant Boisset, writing in
1802 to ask a friend to sell six of his slaves, invoke this property
right: ‚ÄúI give them to you, dear Comrade, and authorize you to sell
them; they are my property.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:30" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote">30</a></sup> Correspondingly, as property, slaves
were to be legally prevented in turn from possessing property of their
own. Section 28 of the code is explicit on this count: ‚ÄúSlaves can
possess nothing which is not their Master‚Äôs, and all that comes to them
by industry or the liberality of other persons‚Ä¶is acquired as the full
property of their Master.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:31" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote">31</a></sup></p>

<p>As such, the slave is to be considered as, analytically‚Äîas opposed to
experientially or phenomenologically‚Äîwhat Marx calls <em>constant capital.</em>
Like any other machine, animal, or tool for production that the
plantation owner purchases as a fixed cost, the entire person of the
slave as means of production, as productive machine, is to be used up as
profitably (i.e., as productively and cheaply) as possible: ‚ÄúIn the
slave system, the money capital laid out on the purchase of labour-power
plays the role of fixed capital in the money form, and is only gradually
replaced as the active life of the slave comes to an end‚Ä¶.The purchase
and sale of slaves is also in its form a purchase and sale of
commodities.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:32" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote">32</a></sup> The bookkeeping practices of the plantation system
make this eminently clear (see fig. 1).</p>

</div>

<p>Marx‚Äôs assertion of the structural equivalency of slaves, machines, and
animals in the plantation mode of production is strikingly confirmed in
this 1792 document from St. Domingue, which summarizes in a single page the
wealth of St. Domingue in the calendar year 1791.<sup id="fnref:33" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote">33</a></sup> The document
tabulates the enormous slave-based wealth of St. Domingue during the
interim period between 1789 and the 6 February 1794 abolition, when
slavery was steadfastly sustained by revolutionary governments nominally
committed to creating a state based on the universal rights of man and
citizen. Despite the strict <em>structural</em> equivalency it asserts between
slaves (‚Äún√®gres‚Äù), lime ovens (‚Äúfours √† chaux‚Äù), horses, mules, and
‚Äúhorned animals,‚Äù the enormous inequality of value between the latter
and the 455,000 slaves the document enumerates is immediately striking.
Even more ironically, by the time the document would have been
communicated to the Metropolitan government‚Äîperhaps by Fran√ßois de
Barb√©-Marbois, the last intendant of St. Domingue‚Äîits content would have
been rendered null by the Northern Plain slave uprising of 21 August
1791 that destroyed many hundreds of the sugar, coffee, and indigo
plantations this document so methodically enumerates and values.</p>

<p>The essential analytical distinction this document conveys, between
slavery and capitalist wage labor, is theoretically grounded in Marx‚Äôs
categorial analysis: ‚ÄúThe capitalist,‚Äù Marx observes in the second
volume of <em>Capital</em>, ‚Äúcannot sell the worker again as a commodity, for
he is not his slave, and the capitalist has bought nothing more than the
utilization of his labour-power for a certain time.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:34" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote">34</a></sup> As such, and
this is Marx‚Äôs key point, in contrast to the wage laborer, no form of constant capital (whose value component, in other words,
remains constant), including slaves, is able to produce the essential
and defining element of capitalism‚Äîincremental increases in surplus
value‚Äîbut instead merely passes on to a commodity preexisting value. Though enabling the <em>capture</em> of market profit by their
owner, they themselves <em>produce</em> only material use values (sugar, coffee).<sup id="fnref:35" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote">35</a></sup></p>

<p>Among the key factors Marx identifies in the transition to the
capitalist mode of production, the imposition of the contractual wage
labor relation is key.<sup id="fnref:36" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote">36</a></sup> It allows for extraction of surplus value
from living labor, a unique feature of the capitalist mode of
production. Moreover, one might add, among the key points <em>The Black
Jacobins</em> as a whole makes eminently clear is that the historical
transition from slavery to capitalism is precisely not gradual and
tendential but revolutionary, the explosive and often violent
destruction of one system and its replacement by another: 1791, 1804,
1848.<sup id="fnref:37" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote">37</a></sup></p>

<p>In notebook 2 of the <em>Grundrisse</em>, written in November 1857, Marx makes
what in the context of James‚Äôs assertions is an extremely interesting
observation on plantation slavery in the United States and its relation
to capitalism: ‚ÄúNegro slavery‚Äìa purely industrial slavery‚Äîwhich is,
besides, incompatible with the development of bourgeois society and
disappears with it, presupposes wage labour, and if other, free states
with wage labour did not exist alongside it, if, instead, the Negro
states were isolated, then all social conditions there would immediately
turn into pre-civilized forms.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:38" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote">38</a></sup> In this brief but dense comment,
Marx observes that while American slavery is ‚Äúindustrial‚Äù in scale and
methods of production, this does not mean it is any sense approaching or
taking the form of the capitalist <em>mode of production</em>; this is the case
because a mode of production as Marx understands it is a <em>form of social
relations</em> (property, legal, political, familial, reproductive,
economic, etc.) and not a mere (‚Äúindustrial‚Äù) method of producing use
values. As such, he states, US (‚Äúnegro‚Äù) slavery remains ‚Äúincompatible
with the development of bourgeois society,‚Äù an entirely distinct
(social) mode of production. Nonetheless, it exists historically within
a broader socio-economic American context based on capitalist wage
relations (‚Äúfree states with wage labour‚Äù), and even shares certain
superficial similarities with that larger economic context (industrial
scale of production, etc.). Left on its own, however, its <em>social form</em>
would revert, Marx asserts, to its own inherent, purely precapitalist,
‚Äúpre-civilized‚Äù (slavery is, Marx observes, fundamentally barbaric)
forms of appearance.<sup id="fnref:39" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote">39</a></sup></p>

<p>Analogously, while slavery in St. Domingue existed in a wider
eighteenth-century context of increasing industrialization of production
and imposition of wage labor, and despite the fact that it adopted some
of the superficial forms of appearance of nascent capitalism (‚Äúworking
and living together in gangs of hundreds on the huge sugar-factories‚Äù),
as a mode of production, in Marx‚Äôs sense of the term, slavery in St.
Domingue remained entirely distinct from early Atlantic capitalism,
barbarically premodern, a social form and mode of production in which
humans constituted legal, machinic property (see fig. 2).</p>

<p>The complex, overdetermined historical process of the transition from
plantation slavery to the industrial production of sugar in Guadeloupe
and Martinique in the 1840s in fact serves precisely to underscore the
imperative of analytical clarity regarding the problem of transition. If
in the years immediately prior to the 1848 abolition there developed a
series of bizarre anomalies in the system, from the renting out of
‚Äúslaves‚Äù who then received salaried employment in the towns and cities,
to the various documented cases of so-called slaves actually employing
and paying salaries to their so-called masters, such phenomena testify
not to the gradual, linear, becoming-capitalist of the plantation mode
of production but instead to the chaotic breakdown and ‚Äúdecomposition‚Äù
of a secular social structure, the anarchic disordering of the
distinguishing characteristics of the slave-based mode of production as
social-form, prior to its industrial restructuration after 1848.<sup id="fnref:40" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote">40</a></sup></p>

<p>Such chaotic mutations and anomalies of the transition from slavery to
capitalism are the stuff of the historical record. To make sense of them
requires‚Äîbeyond the mere registration and cumulative narration of their
phenomenal appearance scattered across the archival records‚Äîthe clear
conceptual distinction between two modes of production that Marx
developed across the three volumes of <em>Capital</em>, such that these
incongruous and inconsistent <em>facts</em> might be subject to an analytical
measure: if a well-off ‚Äúslave‚Äù who employs his ‚Äúmaster‚Äù for a wage to
make from this labor a profit is perhaps not yet a capitalist, prior to
gaining the legal entitlements of abolition, he no longer, beyond any
doubt, functions socially and economically as a slave.</p>

<p>While much has been written on the relation of slavery and capitalism,
the question has arguably never been addressed in terms adequate to
Marx‚Äôs categorial, structural analysis in <em>Capital.</em><sup id="fnref:41" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote">41</a></sup> The place to
begin such a value-form analysis of the slavery and capitalist modes of
production remains Etienne Balibar‚Äôs brilliant, foundational essay in
which he develops for the concept of <em>mode of production</em> the structural
reading of <em>Capital</em> initiated by Louis Althusser in their famous 1965
collaboration <em>Reading Capital</em>.<sup id="fnref:42" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote">42</a></sup> Though Balibar does not discuss
slavery as a mode of production prior to capitalism, the key factors in
the transition to capitalism he identifies in <em>Capital</em> can be readily
applied to the preceding analysis of slavery in Marx‚Äôs conceptual
system.</p>

<p>The central analytical assertion of Balibar‚Äôs complex, book-length
chapter is, from this perspective, that the primary condition for the
existence of the capitalist mode of production is a two-part legal
distinction, ‚Äúthe basic elements of which are the <em>law of property</em> and
the <em>law of contract.</em>‚Äù Under the capitalist mode of production, this
division takes the form of a primary distinction between, firstly, the
‚Äú<em>abstract universalistic character</em>‚Ä¶of <em>human persons</em>‚Äù who are
entitled to enter into <em>contractual</em> relations (i.e., between the
capitalist owner of the means of production and wage labor), and, on the
other hand, the <em>property</em> relation that ‚Äúis established exclusively
between human persons and things (or what are <em>reputed</em> to be persons
and what are <em>reputed</em> to be things).‚Äù ‚ÄúThis system simply distributes,‚Äù
Balibar observes, ‚Äúthe concrete beings which can support its functions
into two categories within each of which there is no pertinent
distinction from the legal point of view.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:43" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote">43</a></sup></p>

<p>While Balibar is here discussing only capitalism, it is immediately
obvious that this criterion constitutes the founding, enabling
distinction between slavery and capitalism as modes of production: if
capitalism distinguishes between the ‚Äúabstract universalistic character‚Äù
of human persons as subjects of right (of the universal, inalienable
right to the property of one‚Äôs self-same person, as well as to the
corresponding, temporally limited right to sell and purchase the
commodity labor power), the legal system subtending slavery knows no
such abstract universality. Under slavery, some human persons are
rights-bearers legally entitled to enter into contracts with other
property owners (to buy and sell slaves and other means of production),
while other human persons (slaves) are considered property, disentitled
from entering into legal contracts, subject to the purchase and use of
their entire person as property. Balibar‚Äôs analysis thus offers a formal
definition of the discrete distinction differentiating these two modes
of production, as opposed to any linear criterion of degree or relative
extension. It constitutes a clear and distinct criterion (possessing, to
be sure, manifold subdistinctions and limitations such as those to be
found in the Code Noir), one that serves analytically to contrast in the
absolute two distinct modes of production. <sup id="fnref:44" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote">44</a></sup></p>

<p>This founding <em>legal</em> distinction then allows for Balibar‚Äôs subsequent
analysis of the key internal factors composing and distinguishing the
capitalist mode of production itself.<sup id="fnref:45" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote">45</a></sup> In a penetrating critique of
the traditional Marxist notion of the development of the forces of
production, Balibar argues that the development of the capitalist mode
of production, when understood analytically rather than empirically, is
radically discontinuous rather than linear and cumulative.<sup id="fnref:46" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote">46</a></sup> In fact,
he argues, the so-called ‚Äúproductive forces are not ‚Äòthings‚Äô at all, but
are instead to be conceived as a <em>relation</em> constituted by a pattern of
arrangement and temporal ‚Äòrhythm‚Äô distinctive to the capitalist mode of
production.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:47" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote">47</a></sup></p>

<p>Balibar derives the nature of this ‚Äúarrangement‚Äù from Marx‚Äôs
presentation of the concept of relative surplus value in three central
chapters of <em>Capital</em>, volume 1, specifically, those focused on the
contrasting modes of production Marx names manufacture and large-scale
industry.<sup id="fnref:48" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote">48</a></sup> The essential transition from precapitalist manufacture
to capitalist industry, in this view, does not consist in a gradual
increase in scale and degree of co-operation, since both manufacture and
industrial production require a complex division of labor that
distinguishes them together from traditional handicraft (see fig.
3).<sup id="fnref:49" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote">49</a></sup></p>

<span class="caption">Figure 3. &quot;Aiguillier,&quot; from Diderot et al., *Encyclop√©die*, vol. 1, plates.</span>

<p>Instead, the crucial analytical distinction (and this will prove key as
well, I will argue below, to distinguish the often highly developed
forms of manufacture in plantation slavery from industrial capitalism)
is that all the various ‚Äúfractional operations‚Äù in the diverse, less-
and more-complexly divided processes of manufacture‚Äîas with handicraft
production‚Äîare still performed <em>manually</em>, through the manual
manipulation, that is to say, of various tools by laborers.<sup id="fnref:50" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote">50</a></sup> The
analytical unity of handicraft and manufacture as modalities of the
manual manipulation of tools constitutes, therefore, the element
founding their common distinction from the capitalist (industrial) mode
of production (fig. 4).</p>

<p>In other words, handicraft and manufacture (including plantation
slavery), distinguished only by their various <em>degrees</em> of division of
labor, nonetheless consist in a more basic unity as modes of production
in which living labor directly manipulates tools in the production
process (see fig. 5).</p>

</div>

<p>The gradual, cumulative increases in productivity observable in the
transition from handicraft to manufacture derive from the
rationalization process applied to each element of a given production
process; rather than a rupture, Balibar writes, the passage from
handicraft to manufacture thus occurs as a continuous ‚Äúextension of the
analytical movement of specialization peculiar to handicrafts, a
movement which simultaneously affects both the perfection of technical
operations and the psychophysical characteristics of the workers‚Äô
labour-power. These are merely two aspects, two faces of one and the
same development. Indeed, <em>manufacture is merely the extreme
radicalization of the distinctive feature of handicrafts: the unity of
labour-power and means of labour</em>.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:51" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote">51</a></sup> The tendencies of scale,
concentration, and division of labor observable in the plantation
production processes of St. Domingue, characteristics that James names
‚Äúproletarian,‚Äù are, I would argue, analogous to the developments in Adam
Smith‚Äôs pin manufactures, inherent, that is to say, to ‚Äúmanufacture‚Äù
rather than ‚Äúlarge-scale industry‚Äù (in Marx‚Äôs sense of the terms).</p>

<p>In contrast, Balibar argues, the crucial distinguishing shift from
manufacture to fully capitalist industrial production is the suppression
of the anthropological function of living labor as ‚Äútool-bearer‚Äù (see
fig. 6).</p>

</div>

<p>The introduction of machinery and mechanized production suppresses the
direct contact of labor with the object of labor (the commodity), and an
entirely distinct criterion for the development of the production
process replaces the (analytically) previous division and specialization
of living labor via its manual manipulation of tools.<sup id="fnref:52" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:52" class="footnote">52</a></sup> In its place,
development under industrial production occurs as the tendential
replacement and <em>elimination</em> of manual labor by machine production. Not
only is production henceforth organized independently from the
anthropological characteristics of human labor power and its
rationalization, but development furthermore occurs as a separation of
living labor from the means of labor (i.e., machines).<sup id="fnref:53" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote">53</a></sup></p>

<p>Instead of the unity of living labor and the means of labor (tools)
characteristic of handicrafts and manufacture, an entirely distinct
structural unity takes its place: ‚ÄúThe unity of the means of labor and
the object of labor.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:54" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:54" class="footnote">54</a></sup> Crucially, it is not the <em>historical</em>
introduction of machine tools such as the steam engine that is at issue
in Marx‚Äôs categorial analysis (though of course he notes these empirical
phenomena in passing) but the <em>theoretical expression</em> of this
dislocation as the succession of two <em>forms of relation</em> characteristic
of handicrafts/manufacture versus industry, a displacement, that is to
say, from (1) the unity of the means of labor (tools) and living labor
to (2) an entirely distinct unity of the means of labor (machines) and
the object of labor (commodities).<sup id="fnref:55" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:55" class="footnote">55</a></sup></p>

<p>This displacement, analytically rather than empirically apprehended,
entails, Balibar concludes,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>a reorganization of the entire system, of the relation of the real
appropriation of nature, of the ‚Äúproductive forces.‚Äù‚Ä¶The machine which
replaces the ensemble of tools and educated, specialized labor-power
is in no way a product of the development of that ensemble. It
replaces the previous system by a different system: the continuity is
not that of elements or individuals, but of functions‚Ä¶.The subject of
development is nothing but what is defined by the succession of the
forms of organization of labour.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:56" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:56" class="footnote">56</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The point to be taken from this excursus on the structural logic of the
capitalist mode of production is not merely that the displacement of
plantation slavery by industrial capitalism is not to be understood, as
James argues, as a gradual, linear process of complexification of the
division of labor and numerical expansion of its labor force
(historically real but irrelevant factors, in this view, in
distinguishing these two modes of production).<sup id="fnref:57" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:57" class="footnote">57</a></sup> Moreover, in the
terms of Marx‚Äôs categorial analysis, this distinction can only be
adequately apprehended analytically, as a discrete <em>displacement</em> from
one relation of factors to another.<sup id="fnref:58" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:58" class="footnote">58</a></sup></p>

<p>Such an analysis ultimately points, then, to the inherent <em>necessity</em> of
this displacement as industrial capitalism and the value-form became the
predominant structural logic of Atlantic societies. One of the principal
conclusions Marx drew from his critique of political economy is that
capital attains its fully developed form only with the real subsumption
of labor and the predominance of the extraction of relative rather than
absolute forms of surplus value‚Äîa process manifest historically as the
supplanting of manual labor by automatic machinery.<sup id="fnref:59" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote">59</a></sup> From this it is
clear that the manual manipulation of tools by slaves, like the use of
horses, mules, and wind power‚Äîno matter what the degree of division of
labor, accumulation of labor power, or intensity and rate of
production‚Äîmust be displaced by machinic, automated production processes
subject to continuous revolutions in productivity, in order to realize
the inherently infinite demand of capital for ceaseless increases of
surplus value. This is to say, that the living labor of horses, mules,
and slaves can be pushed only to certain absolute limits in intensity
and duration of the working day (what Marx termed the extraction of
<em>absolute</em> surplus value); the elimination of animal labor, and the
displacement of living human (slave) labor that Marx and Balibar
describe, are in this view essential, necessary moments in the
development of capitalism to its fully adequate, industrial form.</p>

<p>More than mere semantics, the debate over the relation of plantation
slavery to the rise of capitalism remains in question today.<sup id="fnref:60" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:60" class="footnote">60</a></sup> In
their unparalleled originality and critical force, both Marx‚Äôs <em>Capital</em>
and James‚Äôs <em>The Black Jacobins</em> remain as relevant as ever to this
discussion. If James was arguably less engaged in the systematic
critique of capitalism than its revolutionary overthrow across the
global south, to read these two texts together can provoke a
multiplication of their analytical and rhetorical powers.</p>

<p>As such, the preceding analysis implies that the entire debate over the
transition from slavery to capitalism since Eric Williams, whether for
or against and for all its real historical insights, has been in a
certain sense misguided. This is arguably so insofar as the a priori
question at stake‚Äîwhether the wealth produced by plantation slavery
enabled the initiation of and transition to capitalism‚Äîis incapable of
furnishing an adequate response to the debate. The production of various
forms of wealth and their social distribution is a transhistorical
anthropological constant, as such irrelevant to the distinction between
these two social forms. Wealth, moreover, is a mere superficial form of
appearance of capital, Marx argues, incapable of accounting in its
quantification for the analytical and historical distinction between
these two modes of production. To argue otherwise is to reject the most
basic insights of Marx‚Äôs critique‚Äîof so-called primitive accumulation
and the basic distinction between the dual forms of value (use-value and
exchange-value) and of labor (living-labor and abstract)‚Äîand to revert
to mere left Ricardianism. It is to assert the mere negative flipside of
the tired myth of primitive accumulation: in the place of the good,
Calvinist protocapitalists saving and reinvesting their profits to
jumpstart industrial capitalism, one instead blames or exculpates the
bad slave owners. Primitive accumulation, Marx showed, addressed instead
the forcible, often violent replacement of one juridical structure and
accompanying mode of production with another.¬†</p>

<p>The slaves of St. Domingue were no proletariat in the modern senses Marx
has given the term. Plantation slavery certainly contributed enormous
wealth to the Atlantic North, wealth that allowed for the imposition of
the capitalist social form, but in itself it did not constitute a form
of primitive accumulation and remained till its destruction analytically
distinct from the industrial capitalist mode of production. Slavery in
St. Domingue was modern, all too modern, only in the scale of its
dehumanizing brutality and violence.</p>

<p>C. L. R. James was among the most original writers and thinkers of
revolutionary Marxism. Decades ahead of his time, he drew the
consequences of his penetrating historical analyses of the Haitian and
Bolshevik Revolutions to argue that African Americans constituted a
revolutionary class; as he wrote in a 1939 resolution to the Socialist
Worker‚Äôs Party, African Americans ‚Äúare designated by their whole
historical past to be, under adequate leadership, the very vanguard of
the proletarian revolution.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:61" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:61" class="footnote">61</a></sup> While James was a radically inventive
and visionary political thinker, he analyzed and presented the problem
of the transition from feudalism and plantation slavery to industrial
capitalism not via Marx‚Äôs structural analysis of the forms, factors, and
tendencies of the capitalist mode of production, but in vital,
politico-historical terms: ‚ÄúWhat are the decisive dates in the modern
history of Great Britain, France, and America? 1789, the beginning of
the French Revolution; 1832, the passing of the Reform Bill in Britain;
and 1865, the crushing of the slave-power in America by the Northern
states. Each of these dates marks a definitive stage in the transition
from feudal to capitalist society.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:62" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:62" class="footnote">62</a></sup> When James did speak of the
‚Äúscientific‚Äù analysis of history, as, for example, in his 1940 article
‚ÄúTrotsky‚Äôs Place in History,‚Äù he did so as an affirmation of an
empiricist methodology: ‚ÄúTrotsky claimed and irrefutably demonstrated
that his history was scientific in that it flowed from the objective
facts. He challenged anyone to question his documentation.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:63" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:63" class="footnote">63</a></sup></p>

<p>For all the immense accomplishments of Trotsky‚Äôs and James‚Äôs famous
works, they remain linear, narrative histories of the events they
present, entirely distinct, methodologically and analytically, from
Marx‚Äôs categorial presentation of the underlying social forms,
relations, and structures of the capitalist mode of production. For the
most part, the aims and accomplishments of <em>The Black Jacobins</em> and
<em>Capital</em> remain entirely distinct. The specific problem of the
transition from feudal slavery to capitalism is arguably, however,
impossible to adequately treat from the perspective of a linear
narrative description of a political history that James adopts, and
demands instead Marx‚Äôs properly scientific mode of analysis and his
narrative presentation of a conceptual logic in a discursive form
utterly distinct from the linearity of historiographic inquiry.<sup id="fnref:64" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:64" class="footnote">64</a></sup>
What is more, the logic of <em>Capital</em> itself must be conceived differentially, as a
dominant order of logical exposition (of the value-form) in
overdetermined tension with other, heterogeneous orders that ‚Äúinterrupt
and cut across the first,‚Äù delimiting and marking off the contingent
necessity of Marx‚Äôs analytical focalization on the social logic of
valorization.<sup id="fnref:65" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:65" class="footnote">65</a></sup></p>

<p>The unparalleled brilliance of <em>The Black Jacobins</em> lies elsewhere.</p>

<p>As James was the first to show, the black Jacobins of the Haitian
Revolution were, if anything, even more modern, more radically,
uncompromisingly modern than the Robespierreist French Jacobins who
initiated the destruction of late feudalism and the world-historical
imposition of justice as equality.<sup id="fnref:66" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:66" class="footnote">66</a></sup> James‚Äôs history of their
unyielding will to destroy slavery and to impose, by any means
necessary, universal emancipation from its misery remains one of the
great narrative analyses of leftist revolutionary history, equaled in
originality of insight and rhetorical force perhaps only by Marx‚Äôs own
1871 visionary history of the Commune and the incipient actuality of
communism, <em>The Civil War in France.</em></p>

<p>To pair James and Marx is not to play one off against the other in a
zero-sum critical ploy but rather to initiate, productively, a more
complexly wrought interrogation of the transition from slavery to
capitalism, one in which the analysis of these two discrete modes of
production enables a more encompassing critique of the discrepant
multiplicity of any mode of production in transition. Transition, in
this view, is not to be grasped as the idealist metamorphosis of the
structure (the structure is, as Marx famously said, not the materialist
real itself but its <em>reproduction</em> as a
‚Äúthought-concrete‚Äù [<em>Gedankenkonkretum</em>]).<sup id="fnref:67" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:67" class="footnote">67</a></sup> Instead, the preceding
analysis can hope to initiate consideration of transition as the complex
‚Äúrecombination of elements‚Äù in what Althusser famously named <em>d√©calage</em>,
or noncorrespondence, the historical passage between the various
divergent forms and temporalities of the legal, economic, productive and
reproductive, racial, gendered, and political components of the
historical transition from slavery to capitalism.</p>

      <p>See James, <em>The Black Jacobins</em>, 283, 284. This is the case as
well with the single other extensive reference to the proletariat in
<em>The Black Jacobins</em>, the memorable passage from the 1963 appendix,
‚ÄúFrom Toussaint Louverture to Fidel Castro,‚Äù that echoes the initial
formulation I have cited. In his 1963 revision, James underscores
the transformative force of ‚Äúthe large-scale agriculture of the
sugar plantation, which was a modern system‚Äù: ‚ÄúIt further required
that the slaves live together in a social relation far closer than
any proletariat of the time. The cane when reaped had to be rapidly
transported to what was factory production‚Ä¶.The Negroes, therefore,
from the very start lived a life that was in its essence a modern
life‚Äù (392). In comparison with the earlier passage I am
considering, here James reiterates the conclusion he had first drawn
in 1938 from this proto-industrial form of the plantation, repeating
the original terms of his argument: the defining characteristics of
the proletarian condition are again summarized as (1) the
‚Äúlarge-scale‚Äù of production processes, (2) the rapid internal
distribution of raw materials to ‚Äúfactory production,‚Äù and (3) the
intensive proximity of living conditions. In the absence of any more
explicit definition of the term, I would argue that <em>proletariat</em> is
for James, writing in 1963, simply to be equated with a

      <p>James‚Äôs <em>World Revolution</em> is redolent with references to ‚Äúthe
dictatorship of the proletariat‚Äù (100, 103, 105); ‚Äúthe
petty-bourgeoisie and the proletariat‚Äù (84); ‚Äúthe revolutionary
proletariat‚Äù (106); ‚Äúthe Russian proletariat‚Äù (122); ‚Äúthe

‚Äúthe advanced proletariat‚Äù (232); ‚Äúthe great German proletariat‚Äù

<em>World Revolution</em> clearly serve to drive home the revolutionary,
Trotskyist argument of James‚Äôs history, the fact that James thought
it unnecessary to define the term with any specificity in 1937 is
nonetheless undoubtedly symptomatic, in the full Althusserian sense
of the term. Symptomatic, that is to say, of what is arguably a
traditional, Leninist interpretation of Marx and <em>Capital</em> more
specifically as a critique made from the standpoint of labor rather
than that of capitalism as a social totality. On the latter, see
Moishe Postone, <em>Time, Labor, and Social Domination: A
Reinterpretation of Marx‚Äôs Critical Theory</em> (Cambridge: Cambridge
University Press, 1993). James‚Äôs critique of global capitalist
imperialism, for all its brilliance, arguably remained a political
critique of class-based exploitation that rarely if ever drew on the
theoretical insights of Marx‚Äôs categorial critique of political
economy. James will write in this vein, in his 1944 essay ‚ÄúThe
American People in ‚ÄòOne World,‚Äô‚Äù that ‚Äúthe laws of dialectics are to
be traced not in metaphysical abstractions‚Ä¶but in economic
development and the rise, maturity, and decline of different social
classes within the expansion and constriction of the capitalist

      <p>Unsurprisingly, James appears to have read the three volumes of
<em>Capital</em> intensively, though not until well after the composition
of <em>World Revolution</em> and <em>The Black Jacobins</em>. James thus asserted
in a 1939 letter to Constance Webb his intention to study in its
entirety Marx‚Äôs magnum opus: ‚ÄúAnd now for <em>Das Kapital</em>. My dear
young woman, I have some news for you. One CLR James, reported
marxist having thought over his past life and future prospects,
decided that what he needed was a severe and laborious study of?
guess! The Bible? Wrong. Ferdinand the Bull? Wrong again. Not <em>Das
Kapital</em>? Right. I shall do these three volumes and nothing will
stop me but a revolution‚Äù (qtd. in Bogues, <em>Caliban‚Äôs Freedom</em>, 53).
Despite this familiarity, and in contrast to his extensive
commentaries on Marx‚Äôs <em>1844 Manuscripts</em> and Hegel‚Äôs <em>Science of
Logic</em>, texts that he critiqued intensively with Raya Dunayevskaya
and the other members of the Johnson-Forrest Tendency, James never
seems to have undertaken a similar critical appraisal of Marx‚Äôs
<em>Capital</em>. The one exception is his 1967 talk ‚ÄúMarx‚Äôs <em>Capital</em>, the
Working-day, and Capitalist Production,‚Äù in which James discusses
not the concept of labor power or the capitalist mode of production
(concepts at issue in the present essay) but chapter 10 of
<em>Capital</em>, vol. 1, on the lived experience of class struggle over
the duration of the working day: ‚Äú[Marx] is concerned with what is
happening to members of the working-class as living human beings in
a factory.‚Äù C. L. R. James, <em>You Don‚Äôt Play with Revolution: The
Montreal Lectures of C. L. R. James</em>, ed. David Austen (Edinburgh:
AK, 2009), 151. It is in any case certain that a central dimension
of the intellectual project of the Johnson-Forrest Tendency in the
1940s involved a close reading of Marx‚Äôs <em>Capital</em>, a reading the
group brought to bear against their corresponding intensive
study of Hegel‚Äôs <em>Logic</em>. Grace Lee Boggs observed in 1947, ‚ÄúAs soon
as C. L. R. discovered that I could read German and had studied
Hegel, he had me translating sections of <em>Das Kapital</em> and comparing
the structure of capital with Hegel‚Äôs logic‚Äù (qtd. in Bogues,

      <p>That one finds in <em>Capital</em> differing, even contradictory, uses and
definitions of the concept <em>proletariat</em> is not surprising, given
the often rough and unfinished nature of its three volumes. While it
is well known that after Marx‚Äôs death, Engels constructed volumes 2
and 3 for publication from various drafts Marx left in his papers,
even volume 1‚Äîthe publication of which Marx oversaw through its
second, revised German edition and first French translation
(1872‚Äì75)‚Äîbears no final form; Marx intended and made notes for a
further complete revision of it in 1881 (which he never carried
out). What we know as volume 1 is a bricolage Engels made of the
second German edition of 1872 and the French edition of 1872‚Äì75.
While the first draft of volume 1 from 1863 is lost (the
<em>Grundrisse</em> of 1857‚Äì58 is not, properly speaking, a draft of
<em>Capital</em> but a mass of preparatory notes that Marx termed an
‚Äúinquiry‚Äù [<em>Forschungsweise</em>]), the first German edition of 1867
as well as Marx‚Äôs notes for his intended 1881 revision contain many
important formulations and developments of his demonstration (in
particular, a radically different presentation of the key first
chapter on the value-form) absent from Engels‚Äôs posthumous
‚Äúdefinitive edition.‚Äù In fact, attention to the totality of Marx‚Äôs
drafts, notebooks, and letters from 1857 to 1881, gradually becoming
available in the definitive MEGA^2^ edition of Marx and Engels‚Äôs
works, leads to the conclusion, in Michael Heinrich‚Äôs words, that
‚Äúin a strict sense, a three-volume work ‚ÄòCapital‚Äô written by Marx
does not really exist‚Ä¶.There is no clear difference between drafts
and the final work‚Äîwe have only differently developed drafts of a
shifting, unfinished and incomplete project.‚Äù Michael Heinrich,

that these various iterations of Marx‚Äôs project reveal distinct and
ambivalent understandings of such key concepts as ‚Äúvalue‚Äù and
‚Äúlabor-power,‚Äù it is hardly surprising that this should be the case
for concepts of lesser importance to Marx‚Äôs categorial critique,
such as ‚Äúproletariat.‚Äù Moreover, here I am only considering the

      <p>Marx, <em>Capital</em>, 1:896. Marx‚Äôs famous historical example is that
of the Scottish Crofters, the dispossession of whom created a labor
‚Äúreserve army,‚Äù one willing and indeed forced subsequently to take
on wage labor for their very survival. Similarly, he writes of the
Italian case: ‚ÄúIn Italy, where capitalist production developed
earliest, the dissolution of serfdom also took place earlier than
elsewhere. There the serf was emancipated before he had acquired any
prescriptive right to the soil. His emancipation at once transformed
him into a ‚Äòfree‚Äô proletarian, without any legal rights, and he
found a master ready and waiting for him in the towns‚Äù (<em>Capital</em>,
1:876). On the centrality of such transformations of property rights
for the imposition of capitalism, see Ellen Meiksins Wood, <em>The
Origin of Capitalism: A Longer View</em> (1999; repr., New York: Verso,
2017). Wood argues convincingly that the essential factor in the
imposition of capitalism as a social form is the transformation of
property rights. More specifically, this transformation made
inaccessible to the impoverished classes (such as the Scottish
Crofters) the basic amenities essential for survival, such as food
and shelter. Cast out by the Scottish Lords from their secular
homesteads as rightless, ‚Äúfree‚Äù proletarians (in Marx‚Äôs example),
they were forced to accept the contractual conditions of capitalist
wage labor in, for example, the Glasgow shipyards in order to
purchase the means of survival and their reproduction on the market

taxes and employment requirements) effectively forced former slaves
(despite various and unrelenting resistance) to accept the new
conditions of contractual wage labor on the plantations: ‚ÄúThose

voluntarily in many instances. The ex-slaves incurred expenses
unknown to the slave. Food, medical bills, clothing, rents‚Äîall

      <p>To further develop this argument, the distinction I am presenting
between James‚Äôs linear, developmental understanding of the relation
of slavery to capitalism and Marx‚Äôs binary, either/or analysis of
the concept of mode of production should be confronted as well with
James‚Äôs appropriation of Trotsky‚Äôs notion of combined and uneven
development. In this view, plantation slavery would constitute not a
barbaric remnant but a variegated element in the overdetermined
complex of Atlantic modernity. Such a view, however (and this is the
point of the present analysis), by simply positing ‚Äúslavery‚Äù as a
differential element within an equally underdefined totality
(‚Äúcapitalist modernity‚Äù), continues to put forth the question of the
precise, adequate analytical distinction between slavery and
capitalism. On James‚Äôs appropriation and deployment of Trotsky‚Äôs

      <p>Among the key theoretical distinctions Marx makes in his critique
of political economy is that between the production of wealth (in
the form of use values), exchange value (manifest in the form of
prices), and value itself. This fundamental theoretical insight not
only marks Marx‚Äôs decisive break with Ricardian value theory (Marx
was not a Left Ricardian) but remained as well a distinction
generally overlooked by the productivist orientation of traditional,
Leninist Marxism such as that professed, in singular fashion, to be

      <p>‚ÄúIn slave labour, even the part of the working day in which the
slave is only replacing the value of his own means of subsistence,
in which he therefore actually works for himself alone, appears as
labour for his master. All his labour appears as unpaid labour. In
wage-labour, on the contrary, even surplus labour, or unpaid labour,
appears as paid. In the one case, the property-relation conceals the
slave‚Äôs labour for himself; in the other case the money-relation
conceals the uncompensated labour of the wage-labourer. We may

      <p>James in this vein makes a rare analytical commentary on the
historical transformation of American slavery and its approximation
to capitalism in the 1949 essay ‚ÄúStalinism and Negro History‚Äù: ‚ÄúIn
proportion as the export of cotton became of interest to the United,
States, patriarchal slavery was, in the words of Marx, ‚Äòdrawn into
the whirlpool of an international market dominated by the capitalist
mode of production.‚Äô The structure of production relations was
thereby altered. By 1860 there were over 2,000 plantations each with
over a hundred slaves. Division of labor increased. Slaves began to
perform skilled labor, were hired out for wages. Slave production
took on more and more the character of social labor.‚Äù McLemee and Le

      <p>The analytical apprehension of the criteria distinguishing
slavery from industrial capitalism such as I am proposing here does
not ignore, but in fact necessarily precedes and enables, the
obviously more complicated problem of the actual historical
transition between these two modes of production (in colonial
France, globally, etc.). While such an examination lies beyond the
scope of this essay, it might begin, as I suggested above regarding
the 1848 abolition process, by addressing historically the

the union of a certain number of workers, it is a set of fixed
machines ready to receive any workers. From now on, ‚Äòa technique‚Äô is

form to the other can be completely analysed: not as the mere
dissolution of a structure (the separation of the worker from the
means of labour [via so-called primitive accumulation]), but as
the transformation of one structure into another‚Ä¶.It is the forms of

      <p>Ibid., 407, 412. Balibar has recently offered an autocritique of
the structural logic of modes of production developed in his seminal
1965 text: ‚ÄúMy own text in <em>Reading Capital</em> was‚Äîat least this is
how I see it today‚Äîa perfect example of a blind alley into which a
blind use of the concept of structure was directed.‚Äù The object of
Balibar‚Äôs self-criticism is what he now sees as an indiscriminate
deployment of two contradictory senses of structure, that of the
social formation as a ‚Äústructured totality‚Äù possessing in any
historical case a particular and characteristic ‚Äúinvariant,‚Äù
combined with a contradictory attempt to think structure as ‚Äúthe
description of the transformation from one figure to the second,‚Äù
or, in other words, to articulate ‚Äúthe laws of the transformation‚Äù
or transition between modes of production. In the present argument,
needless to say, I do not fully accept Balibar‚Äôs autocritique, with
the essential proviso that the analytical determination of the
actually distinctive elements in such a comparison (legal, economic)
do not constitute an end point but only the very beginning, a mere
but essential prolegomenon to the examination of the complexly
overdetermined and variegated phenomenon of the transition from
plantation slavery to industrial capitalism. Etienne Balibar,
