I"Ô1<p>If Louise Bennett, the prolific Jamaican artist, were still alive and
performing today, how would the Internet fit into her creative practice?
Would she post poetry recordings on Facebook? Would children play with a
Miss Lou app? Would Aunty Roachy deliver wisdom via Twitter? Since
Bennett embraced emerging technologies to teach her audience about the
value of the Jamaican language, social media likely would have played a
prominent role in her education activism. She turned to performance
early in her career to build an inclusive audience, and her media
projects for the Jamaica Broadcasting Corporation‚Äîher children‚Äôs
television show <em>Ring Ding</em> (1970‚Äì82) and her radio program <em>Miss Lou‚Äôs
Views</em> (1966‚Äì82)‚Äîgave her an expanded terrain to develop her
call-and-response poetics. Unfortunately, searching for Bennett online
today yields few actual sound recordings of her poetry. Bennett‚Äôs
underrepresentation online‚Äîor, more aptly, her silence, since her words
can be found but rarely her voice‚Äîis characteristic of Caribbean poetry
more generally. This essay stems from concern about who has the power to
define poetry in virtual spaces and whose voices receive airtime. As
Kamau Brathwaite establishes in his groundbreaking lecture <em>History of
the Voice</em>, anglophone Caribbean poetry should be celebrated for its
‚Äúsound explosions,‚Äù yet it has remained relatively quiet online.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Internet audio archives for poetry have flourished in recent years.
Websites such as <a href="http://writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/">PennSound</a>, the
<a href="http://www.poetryarchive.org/">Poetry Archive</a>, the <a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/">Poetry
Foundation</a>, the <a href="https://www.poets.org/">Academy of American
Poets</a>, and <a href="http://bit.ly/22NdDBL">UbuWeb</a> have
provided excellent resources for contemporary poetics. These
twenty-first-century open-access collections offer both live and studio
recordings, roundtable discussions of poetry, lectures, and taped
interviews.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup> While these digital platforms promise democratization,
they often repeat the exclusions of print archives. Many of these
collections, which now determine the content of poetry syllabi in
university classrooms, reinforce the United States as the dominant
center of anglophone poetry in the Americas.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup> For example, the Poetry
Foundation has 3,649 author pages, almost half of which are devoted to
US poets. The site features only eleven poets from the Caribbean region,
excluding many major voices from the region, such as Louise Bennett. Of
the eleven Caribbean poet pages, none include audio poems and only seven
of them include actual poetry texts; the other four feature just short
author bios. Caribbean poets are more than simply underrepresented in
these curated collections; their online presence is often sparse,
limited to random YouTube videos.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p>Despite their underrepresentation in Web-based audio collections, many
contemporary Caribbean performance poets have embraced digital
technologies to build their audiences. These new digital poetries offer
a solution to what Laurence A. Breiner has characterized as the
‚Äúhalf-life‚Äù of Caribbean performance poems.<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">5</a></sup> According to him,
readers unable to attend a poem‚Äôs live recitation are always at a
disadvantage because things like tone, gesture, and the poet‚Äôs
relationship with her audience also determine meaning. In terms of
distribution, digitized poetry recordings, unhindered by shipping fees
and trade tariffs, surpass print books in their international
portability, making them more accessible to Caribbean diasporic
communities.</p>

<p>This essay examines one of the best examples of innovative digital
poetry in the Caribbean: the youth-led artist collective the <a href="https://twitter.com/2CentsMovement">2 Cents
Movement</a>, based in Trinidad and
Tobago. The performers in this collective use social networking sites to
circulate their video poems.<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote">6</a></sup> Students at the University of the
Southern Caribbean started the movement in 2010, and their activities
have strengthened youth enthusiasm for spoken-word poetry. Some of their
activities include islandwide school tours, open-mic nights, slam
contests, television and radio broadcasts, video production of poems,
and student poetry workshops. They present themselves as a movement to
align their poetry with social change. Their digital recordings become
modes of production, publication, distribution, preservation, and
community activism. Their populist approach builds on the vernacular
pedagogical dynamics of performance established by figures like Louise
Bennett. By using these technologies to integrate creative and political
praxes, the 2 Cents Movement realizes Brathwaite‚Äôs theory of nation
language and his argument that sound reproduction technologies can be
used to reinvigorate Afro-centric oral traditions.<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote">7</a></sup></p>

<p>Brathwaite identifies how nation-language poets challenge the way paper
records were used to discredit oral ways of knowing and uphold
institutional power during colonization. When dub poet Linton Kwesi
Johnson recites his definitive ‚Äú<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8omA7huF6XE">Reggae
Sounds</a>,‚Äù lines such as
‚Äúfoot-drop find drum, blood story / bass history is a moving / is a
hurting black story‚Äù attack print-centric forms of knowledge.<sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote">8</a></sup> He
builds on a history of Caribbean people using performance to circumvent
the print archive to produce, record, and transmit knowledge through
embodied acts.<sup id="fnref:9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote">9</a></sup> Such knowledge depends on the interaction between the
performer and her audience. The format of Bennett‚Äôs <em>Ring Ding</em>, in
which she would invite children from the studio audience to join her on
stage to recite poetry with her, exemplifies this well. Such communal
pedagogies also extend to adult audiences. For example, Oku Onuora
defines the goal of dub poetry as consciousness-raising: ‚ÄúIt also mean
to dub out the isms and schisms and to dub consciousness into the
people-dem head.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:10" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote">10</a></sup> Performance creates what Brathwaite characterizes
as ‚Äútotal expression,‚Äù engendering a space for collective, politicized
vernacular consciousness to take shape: ‚ÄúThe other thing about nation
language is that it is part of what may be called <em>total expression</em>. .
. . Reading is an isolated, individualistic expression. The oral
tradition on the other hand demands not only the griot but the audience
to complete the community: the noise and sounds that the maker makes are
responded to by the audience and are returned to him. Hence we have the
creation of a continuum where meaning truly resides.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:11" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote">11</a></sup> Although
Brathwaite seems to be arguing here that the full experience of the
sonic continuum depends on live interaction, he actually emphasizes the
opposite. A central point of his text, originally titled ‚Äúan electronic
lecture‚Äù for his 1979 Harvard presentation, harnesses the potential of
sound reproduction technologies to create new pathways for total
expression. For him, they intensify ‚Äúthe detonations within Caribbean
sound-poetry [that] have imploded us into new shapes and consciousness
of ourselves.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:12" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote">12</a></sup> Brathwaite‚Äôs combustion metaphors of ‚Äúdetonations‚Äù
and ‚Äúexplosions‚Äù reveal his prioritizing of electronic sound. As
Jonathan Sterne establishes, ‚Äúall sound-reproduction technologies work
through the use of transducers‚Äù that convert acoustic waves into
electronic impulses.<sup id="fnref:13" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote">13</a></sup> Brathwaite suggests that these energy
conversions amplify total expression rather than weaken it, which the 2
Cents Movement substantiates.</p>

<p>So much scholarship focuses on written documents and techniques from the
past, yet many digital humanists are early adopters. They embrace the
unfinished, invite collaboration, move us off the page, and aim to build
things for the future. Inspired by this approach, this essay uses the 2
Cents Movement as a preliminary model to understand how Internet audio
archives can be redesigned to amplify the total expression of Caribbean
poetry. Admittedly, the 2 Cents Movement offers an incomplete solution
to a much larger problem; however, I argue that we need to begin by
examining poets‚Äô engagements with digital technologies to develop better
archival standards and practices in sync with the politics of the work.
In this collaborative spirit, I also invite readers to click on the
links as they read this essay, to immerse themselves in what is already
online and to think about how we can build on this virtual world of
Caribbean poetics.</p>

<p>Part of what makes Brathwaite‚Äôs <em>History of the Voice</em> an important
catalyst for building digital archives is that he avoids the tendency in
oral scholarship to fixate on the live event. For example, Hugh Hodges
stresses the difficulty of studying performance poetry, lamenting that
we typically examine only ‚Äúthe textualized trace of it.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:14" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote">14</a></sup> He
considers sound and video recordings as texts, because he argues that
the total expression of the live event does not get captured on them.
Similarly, Peggy Phelan claims that what she calls ‚Äúliveness‚Äù disappears
in recordings of a performance.<sup id="fnref:15" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote">15</a></sup> As Sterne puts it, this attitude
upholds ‚Äúface-to-face communication and bodily presence‚Äù as ‚Äúthe
yardsticks by which to measure all communicative activity‚Äù and
‚Äúdefine[s] sound reproduction negatively, as negating or modifying an
undamaged interpersonal or face-to-face copresence.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:16" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote">16</a></sup> Brathwaite
takes a more innovative approach to sound reproduction technologies by
highlighting their capacity to challenge print-centric aesthetics. The 2
Cents Movement demonstrates how digital technologies provide even more
opportunities for this through their use of music videography and
microblogging. However, what Brathwaite envisioned more than thirty
years ago through ‚Äúresonating tape[s],‚Äù eight tracks, and LPs has yet
to be fully realized in the broader terrain of our research
methodologies and poetry resources.<sup id="fnref:17" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote">17</a></sup></p>

<p>Critical approaches to performance poetry have been slow to develop
because of the Western assumption that ‚Äúthe text of a poem‚Äîthat is, the
written document‚Äîis primary and that the recitation or performance of a
poem by the poet is secondary and fundamentally inconsequential to the
‚Äòpoem itself.‚Äô‚Äù<sup id="fnref:18" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote">18</a></sup> While the digital should free us from our obsession
with a text-based idiom in literary studies, it has yet to do so.<sup id="fnref:19" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote">19</a></sup>
As this essay demonstrates, even the designs of most online poetry audio
collections still privilege the methodology of textual close reading
rather than encourage us to develop new sound-based methods of
analysis.<sup id="fnref:20" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote">20</a></sup> In a similar vein, recent efforts to build Caribbean
digital archives have focused on converting print documents and have not
engaged as much with sound media.<sup id="fnref:21" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote">21</a></sup> Resources and funding certainly
drive this, since print materials are easier and cheaper to digitize.
Yet given the oral dimensions of Caribbean cultures, we must address how
to represent and archive performance to overcome the structural biases
of print archives.</p>

<h2 id="creating-digital-griots-the-2-cents-movement">Creating Digital Griots: The 2 Cents Movement</h2>

<p>Scrolling through the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/The2CentsMovement/">2 Cents Movement‚Äôs Facebook
page</a> reveals a vibrant
online poetry community. As of December 2015, they have more than 13,000
followers, and its page includes announcements about upcoming
performances, photographs of previous performances, political news
updates, links to live-stream its events, and video poems. Facebook‚Äôs
campus origins explain why this social networking site designed for
college students has played a central role in the development of the
movement. The founder, Jean Claude Cournand, an undergraduate at the
time, sought to build a stronger intellectual youth culture‚Äîto invite
youth to put in their two cents by expressing their views on current
issues (ranging from marijuana legislation to homophobia) through
spoken-word poetry. In an interview, he explained that they chose ‚Äúto go
into the digital habitat rather than trying to reach people through
events alone‚Äù in order to attract a youth audience.<sup id="fnref:22" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote">22</a></sup> Their
best-known projects are the Intercol and Verses national slam
competitions, held annually as part of the Bocas Lit Festival.<sup id="fnref:23" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote">23</a></sup> The
two different slams‚ÄîIntercol features high school teams, and Verses
features prominent poets who compete individually‚Äîreflect their
mentorship structure. The 2015 winner of the Intercol slam, <a href="https://www.bocaslitfest.com/2015/04/08/the-spoken-word-intercol-champion-is/">Michael
Logie</a>,
got to pick a 2 Cents Movement poet as a mentor to work with him for a
year to help him develop his poetry.<sup id="fnref:24" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote">24</a></sup> The 2 Cents Movement has also
collaborated with the Trinidad and Tobago Radio Network on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsZJUoc_yr1ufNZGIsFg74Fl3yuZTNU9k">Free
Speech Project</a>,
for which young artists recite their poems weekly on the radio. These
poems are also produced as videos and archived on the network‚Äôs YouTube
channel.<sup id="fnref:25" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote">25</a></sup> The majority of the movement‚Äôs activities are coordinated
and advertised online, and major events like the slam contests can be
live-streamed. The 2 Cents Movement exists solely through freely
accessible sites and does not have its own server or domain name, which
suggests that a lack of resources does not need to be an obstacle to
building an online presence for Caribbean poetry. In addition to
reaching youth in Trinidad and Tobago, the artists have gained an
international following by circulating their poetry on social media.</p>

<p>Twitter and Facebook updates for the 2014‚Äì2015 Courts Bocas Speak Out
Tour, involving more than fifty secondary schools, demonstrate 2 Cents
Movement‚Äôs use of these platforms to enhance audience interaction.
During this tour, some of the nation‚Äôs best performance poets mentored
high school students as they wrote and performed their own works through
performances and workshops. These school visits provided a way for the 2
Cents Movement to promote the Intercol slam competition. Photo
live-tweets of the tour performances often focused on the students in
the audience actively participating rather than on the poet performing.
In these shots, the camera points at the audience, often catching only
the performer‚Äôs back or the corner of her shoulder.<sup id="fnref:26" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote">26</a></sup></p>

<p>The online viewer gets to stare out at the auditorium filled with
students, which allows her to occupy the performer‚Äôs gaze but also view
a student‚Äôs face as a mirror, inviting her to identify with both the
performer and the audience. This elaborates on the pedagogy offered
during the tour, in which the poets‚Äô performances provide students with
a model for their own poetry aspirations. Visually, Twitter and Facebook
followers become situated in the continuum of total expression‚Äîin the
reciprocal exchange between performer and audience. High school students
who attended a 2 Cents Movement performance at their own school could
then follow them on Twitter and Facebook and connect those images to
their own participation in the live event. The photos (and the movement
as a whole) downplay individual author celebrity in favor of building a
student-focused collectivity. The 2 Cents Movement uses Twitter and
Facebook to create ‚Äúa constancy of presence‚Äù to link together different
high school communities in Trinidad and Tobago.<sup id="fnref:27" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote">27</a></sup></p>

<p>Although these social media platforms governed by the commercial needs
of US-based multinationals certainly hold limitations, rhetoric scholar
Kevin Adonis Browne stresses the possibility for subversive adaptation.
Examining Caribbean Internet users‚Äô chatting, blogging, and
video-sharing practices, he illustrates how users adapt everyday
vernacular practices to assert their presence in digital public spaces
that often render them invisible. While his argument relates to
individuals‚Äô everyday encounters online rather than large-scale digital
projects, the parallels he establishes between ‚Äúa carnivalesque
imperative‚Äù and the Internet lend insight into the 2 Cents Movement‚Äôs
adaptation of social media to expand the power of total expression in
online environments. Rather than view Caribbean folk cultures in
opposition to digital forms, Browne views the inventiveness of both as
part of what makes them compatible. He demonstrates how communal
vernacular practices easily translate to an online environment because
they emerge from ‚Äúa history of adaptability‚Äù necessary for ‚Äúthose who
have had to find a way or make one when none seemed available.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:28" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote">28</a></sup> For
example, in the colonial era, musicians invented steel pan drumming to
get around the ban on using actual drums, managing to make noise in a
colonial environment that aimed to silence them. Corporate social media
platforms also curtail creative expression through their circumscribed
structures. Such restrictions often reinforce the majority voice, yet
Facebook and Twitter have also proven themselves useful for the growth
of subcultures and movements.</p>

<p>Media scholars have identified how Facebook‚Äôs interface encourages users
to adopt neoliberal values. The anthropologist Alex Fattal draws a
connection between a user‚Äôs desire to gain as many likes and friends as
possible and Facebook‚Äôs corporate desire to become the most dominant
social network in the world, characterizing this as ‚Äúthe unspoken logic
of accumulation and curiosity that undergirds‚Äù the platform.<sup id="fnref:29" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote">29</a></sup> To
what extent can this ‚Äúlogic of accumulation and curiosity,‚Äù which sounds
eerily similar to older imperial impulses, be disrupted? By using social
media to augment their performance events, the 2 Cents Movement
intercepts this logic of accumulation by bringing users into the dynamic
of total expression. While scholars often critique Facebook for
weakening face-to-face sociality, the 2 Cents Movement reveals how it
can be used to deepen social connections.<sup id="fnref:30" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote">30</a></sup></p>

<p>Through social media, poets in the 2 Cents Movement also make their
performances part of everyday life. People browse Facebook as they ride
the bus to work or as they wait in line at the grocery store. The 2
Cents Movement often depicts the performance dynamics of such quotidian
spaces in its studio-produced video poems available on YouTube. For
example, its most popular video-poem, ‚Äú<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OA8eLoPylU">Maxi Man Tracking School
Gyal</a>‚Äù (originally titled
‚ÄúYankee‚Äôs Gone‚Äù), by Crystal Skeete, takes place on a Curepe street and
on a bus.<sup id="fnref:31" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote">31</a></sup> Skeete addresses her concern about adult males sexually
preying on underage schoolgirls by writing a poem in the voice of a
teenage girl who refuses their advances. Similar to earlier women poets
such as Miss Lou and Jean ‚ÄúBinta‚Äù Breeze, she uses the dramatic
monologue to give a voice to women who are denied respect in the public
sphere. Through social media, her video becomes even more impactful
because a viewer might be in that particular social space as she watches
the poem and even be witnessing what Skeete describes. This restores an
important aspect of Caribbean oral traditions, in which yard
performances blend into everyday practices rather than become isolated
special events. Miss Lou had a similar aim in her market women poems,
yet her ability to connect her audience to her settings was often
restrained by the artifice of the theater stage. By creating a tangible
bond between the real-life users and the mediated voices in the poems,
the 2 Cents Movement invites users to do more than merely ‚Äúlike‚Äù its
status updates and continue scrolling.</p>

<p>In addition to the microblogging of performances, the 2 Cents Movement‚Äôs
video poems, like Skeete‚Äôs ‚ÄúMaxi Man,‚Äù demonstrate how audiovisual
recording technologies can be used to enhance the communal dynamic of
total expression. The videos challenge the idea that poetry depends on
print publication, since many of the movement‚Äôs well-known poems are
available only in this format. By getting us off the page, the
videography expands the possibilities for how we might edit and archive
performance poetry. Released in 2013, Skeete‚Äôs video went viral on
social media and received more than 88,000 views on YouTube. Her poem
exemplifies the 2 Cents Movement‚Äôs approach, in that she initially
attended one of its workshops as a medical student and is now a leading
poet in the movement. She won the 2013 Verses poetry slam with her
performance of this poem; however, the popular version on the 2 Cents
Movement‚Äôs YouTube channel is a studio recording made by BeatOven
Productions, with videography by Denithy. Rather than aim to recreate
the experience of the live performance event, the video invites the
viewer to feel included in the street scene being depicted. Through
their synthesis of the dramatic monologue form and the music video
genre, Skeete and the 2 Cents Movement team cultivate a sense of
audience connection and encourage dialogue beyond the space of the poem.</p>

<p><span class="caption">Figure 6. Crystal Skeete and the ‚ÄúMaxi Man‚Äù cast, University of the West Indies, St. Augustine Campus, Trinidad and Tobago. Posted on 23 June 2013.</span></p>

<p>Skeete dresses in a government school uniform to play her character in
the video. Her embodiment of the character creates a dialogic
relationship between her persona and her words because her recitation
critiques the behavior that she acts out. The dramatic monologue‚Äôs
implied addressee is another high school girl who is swayed by a maxi
man‚Äôs advances. The speaker warns her that ‚Äúthese free rides are going
to end in horror / trust me / with that nine-month sentence things does
go sour.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:32" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote">32</a></sup> Skeete‚Äôs conversational style, enhanced by the video
editing and camera angles, encourage the viewer to feel as though Skeete
is speaking directly to her. Standing in the middle of the street,
Skeete begins with the lines, ‚ÄúPosing on every street corner / this is
the resurrection of ‚ÄòJean and Dinah‚Äô / ‚Ä¶ / No Yankees here / only
maxi man conductor.‚Äù Referencing Mighty Sparrow‚Äôs calypso hit ‚ÄúJean and
Dinah,‚Äù about how the presence of a World War II US army base led to
prostitution in Trinidad, Skeete draws attention to how girls getting
free bus rides from maxi men for sexual favors re-creates a similar
dynamic. Through an intergenerational call and response, she situates
her poem in the Trinidadian oral tradition. Skeete‚Äôs poem exemplifies
how the 2 Cents Movement aims to cultivate a socially conscious form of
learning that values vernacular language and knowledge.</p>

<p>Similar to music videos, Skeete‚Äôs recitation alternates between a
voiceover and her character speaking onscreen. By playing with the
boundaries between diegetic and nondiegetic sound, the editing
capitalizes on sound‚Äôs permeability, encouraging her virtual audience to
feel a closer connection to her words. Skeete‚Äôs voice extends beyond the
boundaries of the video and infiltrates the listening space, collapsing
the distance between the onscreen performance and the audience‚Äôs
experience of it, especially if they happen to be in a similar setting.</p>

<p>In the narrative that unfolds, the camera angles accentuate Skeete‚Äôs
embodied performance. While conventional music videos often sexually
objectify women‚Äôs bodies, the jump cuts between medium shots, medium
long shots, and close-ups (often from a slight low angle) emphasize
Skeete‚Äôs power as she dramatizes her character‚Äôs self-actualization and
encourages other girls to do the same. Skeete‚Äôs words combined with the
camera work challenge the male gaze to create a virtual space of female
community. This reaches its peak when the speaker sits in the back of
the van reciting her critique and a reverse shot depicts the maxi man
gazing at her in the rearview mirror. His gaze is literally reflected
back at him, while the speaker verbally refuses his objectification. In
the middle of the van, a girl flirts with another maxi man. Throughout
the poem, the speaker seems to completely condemn this behavior;
however, the poem ends with a surprise twist. As she gets out of the
maxi man‚Äôs van, she tells the audience, ‚ÄúThis brown-skinned gyal / going
home and mind she child,‚Äù indicating that her advice is based on her own
mistakes with a maxi man. This surprise ending builds the speaker‚Äôs
authority‚Äînot by separating her from her community but by underscoring
her participation in it‚Äîand encourages schoolgirls watching the poem to
trust her advice.</p>

<p>In a live performance of ‚ÄúMaxi Man Tracking School Gyal,‚Äù Skeete‚Äôs
critique of sexual harassment is likely powerful; however, the video
format allows a viewer to experience with greater clarity the embodied
experience of resisting sexual harassment on the street. For female
viewers who have gone through something similar, the recreation of the
scene and its provocative ending deepens their identification with the
speaker. Like a griot, Skeete speaks for a community of young girls, or
rather speaks with them, since her performance encourages them to bring
their own experiences into their interpretation of the poem.</p>

<p>Unlike many poetry recordings available online, which are taped at live
events, the 2 Cents Movement engages technologies as part of the
artistic composition of the poem through their studio-produced poems. By
borrowing from music videography, they invite us to see performance
archives as something more expansive than as a place to simply store
copies of ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù live events. This moves us beyond what Jonathan
Sterne characterizes as the preoccupation with fidelity, which
advertisers established early on in sound reproduction history. Sterne
reveals how ‚Äúsound fidelity is a story that we tell ourselves to staple
separate sonic realities together.‚Äù It maintains the illusion of
‚Äúreproduced sound as a mediation of ‚Äòlive‚Äô sounds;‚Äù however, ‚Äúthe
‚Äòmedium‚Äô does not necessarily mediate, authenticate, dilute, or extend a
preexisting social relation.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:33" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote">33</a></sup> Rather than view archives only as
spaces to preserve former instances of total expression, we should also
view them as an opportunity to engender new forms of it. Rather than use
recording technologies to recover or preserve a lost history of the
voice, we can use them to actively construct a history of the voice‚Äîto
create a sonic reality in which new social relations can take shape.</p>

<h2 id="redesigning-internet-audio-archives-for-caribbean-poetry">Redesigning Internet Audio Archives for Caribbean Poetry</h2>

<p>The 2 Cents Movement‚Äôs do-it-yourself approach to digitizing poetry
illustrates that a lot can be accomplished by adapting existing
platforms and with limited resources; however, the underrepresentation
of Caribbean poetry online will not be solved solely through social
media and the ‚Äúfree culture‚Äù of the Internet. Merely uploading more
poems to YouTube will not be enough to overcome the structural biases
that silence (and drown out) Caribbean performance poetry online. As
Rick Prelinger establishes, YouTube has become, ‚Äúin the eyes of the
public, the default online moving-image archive.‚Äù <sup id="fnref:34" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote">34</a></sup> Yet it lacks
many of the defining characteristics of archives that make them
valuable, such as a focus on long-term preservation and ‚Äústrictly
codified lines of conduct‚Äù that have been carefully developed through
academic practice and intellectual debate.<sup id="fnref:35" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote">35</a></sup> The underrepresentation
of Caribbean poetry in Internet audio archives is also symptomatic of
the global digital divide, which is especially acute for
Africa-descended populations.<sup id="fnref:36" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote">36</a></sup> However, as Curwen Best points out,
‚ÄúThe flip side to the notion of the digital divide is therefore the
formation of strategic space. It is this strategic space that opens up
an area and arena of knowledge about evolving technologies.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:37" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote">37</a></sup> To
take advantage of ‚Äúthis strategic space,‚Äù this section of the essay
evaluates the standards and practices that have been established by
existing Internet audio archives and considers how a Caribbean poetry
collection could be organized to realize total expression.</p>

<p>A discussion about archiving poetry recordings would be incomplete
without a consideration of the achievements of
<a href="http://writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/">PennSound</a>. As the leading US
collection, it has quickly become the standard for how to create a
Web-based poetry audio archive. University of Pennsylvania professors
Charles Bernstein and Al Filreis started the collection in 2003
primarily for classroom use. It holds over 45,000 poetry recordings,
available for free streaming and download. The files are downloaded
roughly four million times a month.<sup id="fnref:38" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote">38</a></sup> For poetry, this number is
astounding, when one considers the limited print runs and book sales for
contemporary poetry. Although US poets and avant-garde aesthetics tend
to predominate, the site has author pages for some prominent Caribbean
poets, including
<a href="http://writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/x/Brathwaite.php">Brathwaite</a> and
<a href="http://writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/x/Philip.php">M. NourbeSe Philip</a>.
It also holds some of the few <a href="http://writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/x/Bennett.php">Louise
Bennett</a> recordings
available online.<sup id="fnref:39" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote">39</a></sup> The site uses the following archival taxonomies:
authors, series, anthologies, collections, groups, and classics, which
provide the user with a variety of ways to study a poet‚Äôs work. The
<a href="http://writing.upenn.edu/pennsound/manifesto.php">PennSound Manifesto</a>
is worth examining because it has set the precedent for subsequent
Internet poetry collections. Bernstein provides the following criteria
for poetry audio: ‚ÄúIt must be free and downloadable‚Äù; ‚ÄúIt must be MP3 or
better‚Äù; ‚ÄúIt must be singles‚Äù; ‚ÄúIt must be named‚Äù; ‚ÄúIt must embed
bibliographic information in the file‚Äù; and ‚ÄúIt must be indexed.‚Äù These
criteria have proved successful in terms of encouraging widespread use,
particularly on college campuses. PennSound archives each poem
individually (rather than entire events) because this makes poems easier
to find, access, and download, and it allows listeners to create their
own playlists. In Bernstein‚Äôs own words, PennSound adapts ‚Äúa
consumer-oriented MP3 file exchange approach‚Äù for a nonprofit
library.<sup id="fnref:40" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote">40</a></sup> By embedding bibliographic information in the file and
naming each one, it upholds archival standards and ensures that future
researchers will have access to information about the context for the
recording, something a social media platform like YouTube does not
always provide. PennSound‚Äôs straightforward interface, which lets users
select from an alphabetized list of authors, also erases implicit
hierarchies that come from the emphasis on accumulation in social media
sites where voices are forced to compete with each other for likes and
views.</p>

<p>While PennSound‚Äôs open-access model holds a lot of potential for
Caribbean performance poetry, its prioritizing of free resources may not
be as easy to achieve for Caribbean poetry. An extreme example of this
free culture ethos is represented by Kenneth Goldsmith, the founder of
<a href="http://bit.ly/22NdDBL">UBUweb</a>, who for a while maintained a page on
the site called the ‚ÄúWall of Shame‚Äù: he would publically condemn any
artist who asked for her work to be removed from the site by writing her
name on the wall.<sup id="fnref:41" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote">41</a></sup> Unlike Goldsmith, PennSound strives to ensure
that all of its recordings are ‚Äúcleared for copyright to be distributed
free for noncommercial and educational purposes.‚Äù While this democratic
and anticapitalistic approach may seem appealing for Caribbean poetry,
in practice it may be more difficult to implement, particularly for
poets who view performance as a central part of their artistic
production. In the manifesto, Bernstein states that the debates about
file sharing in the music industry do not apply to poetry: ‚ÄúOne of the
advantages of working with poetry sound files is that we don‚Äôt
anticipate a problem with rights. At present and in the conceivable
future, there is no profit to be gained by the sale of recorded
poetry.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:42" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote">42</a></sup> Yet Caribbean poets such as Mutabaruka and Linton Kwesi
Johnson built their careers through their affiliation with the reggae
recording industry and make money from the sales of their albums. The 2
Cents Movement offers its recordings for free; however, as a group of
younger poets, the members may be more willing to share their work
online to build their reputation.</p>

<p>The subject of copyright and fair use for Caribbean performance poetry
is a complex issue that deserves its own treatment in a separate essay.
In terms of the current discussion, it offers another example of the
persistence of print-centrism in poetry scholarship. The emphasis on
free recordings implicitly upholds the idea that the artistic labor of
poetry is more worthy of payment when it is print based. Moreover, it
demonstrates how we define poems as texts rather than as performances.
The Poetry Foundation‚Äôs <a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/"><em>Code for Best Practices in Fair Use for
Poetry</em></a>
underscores this point. A group of poets, editors, and publishers met at
the Poetry Foundation‚Äôs Harriet Monroe Poetry Institute and collaborated
with American University‚Äôs Center for Social Media and its Washington
College of Law in 2011 to create the guide. Although they outline their
purpose as ‚Äúidentifying obstacles preventing poetry from coming fully
into new media and, where possible, imagining how to remove or mitigate
these obstacles,‚Äù almost none of their examples involve poetry
audio.<sup id="fnref:43" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote">43</a></sup> Yet for Caribbean poets, a major stumbling block to ‚Äúcoming
fully into new media‚Äù is a clear set of fair use practices for
performance-based work. In the section ‚ÄúPoetry Online,‚Äù the examples
pertain to the appearance of text on websites. The document concludes
with the section ‚ÄúLiterary Performance;‚Äù however, it addresses only
poets who incorporate poems by other artists into their readings. This
document becomes completely irrelevant for groups like the 2 Cents
Movement, whose members often do not produce text versions of their
poems.</p>

<p>This print-centrism also extends to the design of audio collections. I
agree with Kate Eichhorn, who argues that most poetry sound archives
(both digital and analog) have yet to realize the potential of archiving
sound because of ‚Äúthe widely held assumption [in literary studies]
that the archive is necessarily a space of writing and, hence, opposed
to speech and other performative acts.‚Äù Eichhorn proposes that we need
‚Äúto create a sound archive designed to recover and preserve the
embodied, interactive, and present nature of the performed word.‚Äù In her
assessment, archived poetry recordings too often become ‚Äúflat and
lifeless artifacts.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:44" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote">44</a></sup> Although Eichhorn focuses on avant-garde
poets, her arguments apply to Caribbean poets who foreground sound as an
integral part of the poem‚Äôs meaning. Such work accessible in an archive
designed to disrupt our text-based conceptions of archival knowledge
would undoubtedly lead us more assertively into other forms of knowing
rather than allow the digital to reconsolidate print paradigms.</p>

<p>One notable exception to the underrepresentation of anglophone Caribbean
poets in Internet audio collections is the <a href="http://www.poetryarchive.org/">Poetry
Archive</a>, supported by the Arts Council
of England. This site features more Caribbean poets than most, because
the <a href="http://caribbeanpoetry.educ.cam.ac.uk/">Caribbean Poetry Project</a>‚Äîa
group of scholars and poets from the Cambridge University Faculty of
Education, the Centre for Commonwealth Education, and the University of
the West Indies‚Äîcollaborated with the Poetry Archive to improve
access.<sup id="fnref:45" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote">45</a></sup> Of 476 poets, 23 are from the Caribbean region. While this
is not a huge percentage, it is considerably more than most sites, and
every Caribbean poet page has sound recordings that can be streamed for
free or downloaded for a fee of ¬£0.89. The Poetry Archive, like many
Internet audio archives, specializes in classroom resources. It has a
special page for teaching Caribbean poetry<sup id="fnref:ed1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:ed1" class="footnote">46</a></sup>, with a selection of sound recordings and a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190113025519/https://www.poetryarchive.org/articles/guide-language-caribbean-poetry">guide to the language of Caribbean
poetry</a>.
The Caribbean Poetry Project‚Äôs work with the Poetry Archive demonstrates
how cross-disciplinary and cross-institutional collaborations help to
break down Anglo-centrism.</p>

<p>Yet analyzing the design of the Poetry Archive author pages reveals that
we need to do more than simply add voices to existing archives. As Amy
Earhart cautions, for digital recovery projects for writers of color to
be successful, we also must ‚Äútheorize the technological with the same
rigor as we theorize the content.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:47" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote">47</a></sup> If one compares the recording of
Linton Kwesi Johnson reciting ‚Äú<a href="http://www.poetryarchive.org/poem/di-great-insohreckshan">Di Great
Insohreckshan</a>‚Äù
on the Poetry Archive with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUNQS7Pwwu4">YouTube
recording</a> of him
performing it at an outdoor festival in Venezuela in 2008, the total
expression feels much more resonant in the YouTube version than on the
Poetry Archive site.<sup id="fnref:48" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote">48</a></sup> I make this comparison to illustrate how the
design of the Poetry Archive page mutes the insurrectionary tone of
Johnson‚Äôs poem about the Brixton Riots, not to demonstrate that the
YouTube platform is inherently better at representing total expression.
Obviously, the YouTube video allows the viewer to see Johnson‚Äôs body and
facial expressions, which is not possible with the Poetry Archive audio
recording, but it is not as simple as video versus audio. Although the
sound quality of the video lacks the clarity of the Poetry Archive
recording, the uneven audio levels provide a more authentic experience
of what hearing this poem in a large crowd at an outdoor festival would
feel like. The spontaneity of live performances, including sound
glitches and background noise, becomes part of what Brathwaite
characterizes as the ‚Äúsonority contrasts‚Äù of total expression.<sup id="fnref:49" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote">49</a></sup> As
Eichhorn points out, ‚ÄúThese intruders are precisely what sound
technicians often seek to filter out as they prepare recordings for the
archive.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:50" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote">50</a></sup> The Poetry Archive version of ‚ÄúDi Great Insohreckshan‚Äù
follows the predominant sound-editing style for Internet audio archives.
Martin Spinelli describes this style as ‚Äúthe seamless edit,‚Äù designed to
highlight the poet‚Äôs voice and minimize all other distractions,
including the recording scene (whether live or in-studio) and the
‚Äúmaterial elements of their production.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:51" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote">51</a></sup></p>

<p>In addition to using conventional sound editing, <a href="http://www.poetryarchive.org/poet/linton-kwesi-johnson">Johnson‚Äôs author
page</a> follows
the standard visual design that can be found on the Poetry Archive as
well as on other online poetry collections such as PennSound. His page
features an author portrait (rather than a performance action shot), a
biography, and links to individual poem tracks. Beneath the poem title
and author name, one can click the Play button and listen to the
recording. The Poetry Archive uses a simple audio player that allows a
listener to start, pause, and stop the track. Johnson‚Äôs author biography
explains that his poems on the site were recorded from live performances
and come from his CD <em>LKJ A Cappella Live</em>. Despite the claim that ‚Äúthe
energy of his live recitals gives the recordings a unique electricity,
interspersed with the laughter and applause of audiences around Europe,‚Äù
the seamless editing of ‚ÄúDi Great Insohreckshan‚Äù allows one to listen to
Johnson‚Äôs entire recitation before realizing that it is a live
performance.<sup id="fnref:52" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:52" class="footnote">52</a></sup> Once the poem ends, the only audible audience noises
are a cough and polite applause that slowly fades out. Rather than
convey ‚Äúa unique electricity,‚Äù the cough suggests a subdued audience who
tried to remain silent until the end of the performance. The page
provides no information about the specifics of the event or who the
European audience was, although it sounds as though it might have been a
poetry reading in an academic setting. The track certainly holds no
trace of a communal ‚Äúdub consciousness.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:53" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote">53</a></sup> By not clearly identifying
the track as a single performance, the archive presents it as the
authoritative audio version. In the left-hand margin, under the heading
‚ÄúAbout the Poem,‚Äù it lists the themes as ‚Äúsocial, unrest, race, and
Caribbean‚Äù but provides no information about the Brixton Riots.</p>

<p>Derek Furr notes that while online poetry collections devote attention
to different aesthetics, what unites them is the idea that hearing a
poet voice her own work is crucial to understanding the poem. Yet
despite the interest in vocalization, collections tend to downplay the
setting of the poet‚Äôs performance by providing little information about
when and where the reading occurred and why this particular event was
recorded.<sup id="fnref:54" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:54" class="footnote">54</a></sup> While certain sites, such as PennSound, make sure that
all of the bibliographic info is embedded in the single file with
accurate metadata, often all that this provides is the date and physical
location of the reading. By divorcing the poem from its contextual
setting, this approach erases the reciprocal relationship between the
poet and her audience. Furr proposes that poetry recordings (both live
and in-studio) become valuable because ‚Äúwhen we close listen, we hear
not only the sounds of the poem and the poet‚Äôs voicing of them, but also
the echoes of previous scenes of reading and listening.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:55" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:55" class="footnote">55</a></sup> Through
webpage design and sound editing, the Poetry Archive downplays the
previous audiences of ‚ÄúDi Great Insohreckshan‚Äù so that the online user
feels as though she is the only person in the audience. While the 2
Cents Movement illustrates how cinematic approaches can be used to
deepen total expression, the Johnson example illustrates the value of
preserving the ephemeral qualities of a live performance in a recording
to enrich the listening experience. Furr borrows Charles Bernstein‚Äôs
term <em>close listening</em> to characterize how a user should engage with
audio recordings. Based on his experience with PennSound, Bernstein
proposes close listening as an alternative to close reading, where one
prioritizes the materiality of sound and the aural experience.<sup id="fnref:56" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:56" class="footnote">56</a></sup> Yet,
in practice, how much does close listening on Internet audio archives
actually deviate from close reading?</p>

<p>Annie Murray and Jared Wiercinski, curators of
<a href="http://spokenweb.ca/">SpokenWeb</a>, a collection of recordings of a
Montreal poetry reading series from 1966 to 1977, point out that while
most Internet audio archives make listening the focus, their structure
makes them multimodal.<sup id="fnref:57" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:57" class="footnote">57</a></sup> Accordingly, they stress that the visual
elements of online poetry archives need careful consideration. They
explore ‚Äúwhat kinds of site navigation, audio visualization, design
elements and functionalities could be offered by a Web-based spoken word
interface, and how these might enhance the listening process and,
ultimately, the scholarly endeavor.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:58" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:58" class="footnote">58</a></sup> Because very little
scholarship exists on how people engage with sounded poems, they
acknowledge that their suggestions for ‚Äúa sound archive ‚Äòrecipe‚Äô that
other cultural heritage institutions can follow‚Äù are based on
established reading practices.<sup id="fnref:59" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:59" class="footnote">59</a></sup> They make some helpful suggestions,
including using a waveform display for sound visualization, and
providing listeners with a media player that allows them more control
over the playback. They also suggest incorporating any available images
and videos of the performance event, much like the 2 Cents Movement‚Äôs
photo documentation on Twitter and Facebook. However, other suggestions
such as tethering audio playback with a written transcript keep the
primary focus on reading rather than listening.<sup id="fnref:60" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:60" class="footnote">60</a></sup> For example, on the
Poetry Archive site, beneath the link to play ‚ÄúDi Great Insohreckshan,‚Äù
one can also click on the link ‚ÄúRead This Poem.‚Äù This encourages
scholars to engage in what is, for many, the more familiar interpretive
practice rather than to develop new modes of analysis based on sound. In
digital archives, Bernstein suggests that ‚Äúpoems, set adrift from their
visual grounding in alphabetic texts, might begin to resemble the songs
from which, for so long, they have been divided.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:61" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:61" class="footnote">61</a></sup> However, to
achieve this we need to (1) be wary of a one-size-fits-all approach, and
(2) carefully design visual elements to encourage sonic engagement
rather than to reify a visual economy of text. Such a divide between
song and poem has never existed for anglophone Caribbean performance
poets, yet colonial legacies continue to dictate that we read rather
than listen to this work.</p>

<p>Even when one is listening only, Internet audio archives often recreate
the feeling of reading alone. Clicking on the link and listening to the
poem while one looks at the author portrait (similar to the style found
on book jackets) mimics the experience of solitary reading, where one
feels in private conversation with the author. Simple audio players that
have only a linear time-lapse bar (rather than a more complex waveform
display) encourage the eyes to move from right to left, as they do in
the act of reading. When a poem is presented as a decontextualized
single track, a listener is encouraged to adopt a new critical approach
and treat the poem as a self-contained object. Listening, like reading,
becomes ‚Äúan isolated, individualistic expression‚Äù rather than a communal
endeavor.<sup id="fnref:62" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:62" class="footnote">62</a></sup> Sound reproduction technologies have also encouraged our
hearing to become more individualistic. Using headphones as his example,
Sterne argues that such devices encourage listening to be ‚Äúmore
orientated toward constructs of private space and private property,‚Äù
which encourages ‚Äúsound to become a commodity.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:63" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:63" class="footnote">63</a></sup></p>

<p>In contrast, the 2 Cents Movement recreates the communal experience of
listening to a poem, which is a key part of total expression. Photo
tweets and poetry videos make online members a participatory audience.
We have much work to do to figure out how to build Internet audio
archives that recreate this communal experience of listening.
Everything‚Äîincluding sound editing, interface, database design,
navigation system, and copyright issues‚Äîneeds careful consideration to
realize the digital potential of total expression. To embark on this
work, it is crucial that we turn to the poets themselves and build on
their education legacies.</p>

<p>So much of the history of the voice has already been lost, or muted, by
the ongoing colonial bias toward nation language as well as limited
resources and funding. Caribbean poetry recordings that survive, buried
in dusty boxes in attics and library storage rooms, sit silently waiting
for new audiences to return to them ‚Äúthe noise and sounds that the maker
makes.‚Äù<sup id="fnref:64" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:64" class="footnote">64</a></sup> Since these reel-to-reel tapes, cassettes, eight tracks,
CDs, and LPs are fragile media, threatened by technological obsolescence
and (sometimes) the tropical Caribbean climate, we must make digitizing
this vital record of Caribbean poetry history a priority.</p>
