## Project statement by Elise Foote, Winnie E. Pérez Martínez and Charlotte Rogers

As Hurricane Maria pummeled Puerto Rico in the early morning hours of
September 19th, 2019, Sarabel Santos-Negrón huddled with her mother in
the bathroom of her apartment, hoping that the cement walls would
protect them from flying debris. Amid the chaos, Santos-Negrón began to
record the eerie sounds of the storm as a way of occupying her anxious
mind. The wailing of the wind and the violent collision of household
objects became the soundtrack to her immersive installation piece,
"[Groundscapes Displaced](http://coastsincrisis.net/groundscapesdisplaced)." When
pianist and composer Alfonso Fuentes Colón emerged from his home on
September 20th, he noticed that the native trees in his neighborhood,
some of them hundreds of years old, had been uprooted and fractured by
the storm. In the months without electricity that followed, Fuentes
bought a battery-operated keyboard and composed "[Ode to the Fallen Trees](http://coastsincrisis.net/odetothefallentrees)" in a state of
inspired mourning. In the Florida Keys, Sally Binard salvaged wood from
her home, destroyed in Hurricane Irma, and made a self-portrait from the
wreckage: in "Afraid to Launch," nails embedded in the wood form a halo
around her face. What drove Santos-Negrón, Fuentes, and Binard to create
in the midst of destruction? Why did they respond to loss with art? With
the needs for shelter, food, and water often going unmet, why do the
arts matter after a hurricane?

These questions animate [*Coasts in Crisis: Caribbean Arts and Cultures After Hurricanes*](http://coastsincrisis.net/), a digital humanities
exhibit featuring art, music, poetry, and conversation from artists who
experienced Hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017. The site transforms a
local event held at the University of Virginia on September 19th, 2019
into a freely accessible, curated digital art exhibition. *Coasts in
Crisis* documents human ingenuity and creativity in the face of
unthinkable loss. At once an artistic documentation of individual
experiences and a collective expression of Caribbean survival, *Coasts
in Crisis* offers several answers to the question of why art matters
after disaster.

### Project Origins and Contribution

"Coasts in Crisis" began as an interdisciplinary artistic gathering on
September 19th, 2019, the two-year anniversary of Hurricane Maria's
landfall in the Caribbean. As part of the Environmental Humanities
Convergences Festival at UVa, the live event brought together artists
from Florida, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico, all of whom were
affected by the storms. They played music, displayed photography and
installation art, read poetry, and discussed the role of art after a
hurricane. The gathering recognized the exchange of ideas and
collaborations that arise when artists occupy the same physical space.

The second phase of the endeavor is [Coasts in Crisis: Caribbean Arts and Cultures After Hurricanes](http://coastsincrisis.net/), a website
that transforms the physical event into a digital exhibit. Its content
includes visual and aural responses to the hurricanes including poetry,
still images of photography and mixed media, sound recordings, and a
video of the artists' panel discussion from the live gathering on
September 19th, 2019. The digital project also includes interviews with
individual artists and a brief curatorial explanation for each artistic
piece. Our main goal in creating the site was to showcase the
archipelagic impact of and responses to the 2017 hurricane season in
art, music, and literature. More broadly, this project seeks to use the
digital realm to connect hurricane survivors through art, both within
the archipelago and beyond it, thus contributing to and expanding the
"digital turn" in Caribbean arts and letters.

"Coasts in Crisis" aims to mobilize art to foster solidarity across
islands and to build relationships beyond the archipelago, outside of
colonial dynamics, in both its physical and digital iterations. The
colonial legacies of slavery, environmental degradation, and financial
and political exploitation apparent today contribute to the discounting
of Caribbean lives and landscapes in the aftermath of disaster. In the
face of what artist David Berg calls the "Deafening Silence" of the U.S.
towards its territories after the hurricanes, creative practices emerge
as a means through which colonized peoples can make their voices heard.

%}

Beyond the popular term "artivism," poetry, music, and art matter after
disaster because they can reframe how we see and hear the world to offer
innovative solutions to ecological and social crises. The digital
exhibit of "Coasts in Crisis" seeks to make the artists' insights freely
accessible to anyone with an Internet connection by illuminating points
of commonality with other peoples and environments affected by tropical
storms.

Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria in 2017 caused severe damage across
Texas, Florida, and the Caribbean, disproportionately affecting those
who live amid precarity on a daily basis and, as with Hurricane Katrina
in 2004, laying bare the social inequities that predated the storms.
Moreover, the colonial status of Puerto Rico, St. Croix, and other
non-sovereign areas of the Caribbean has been driven home by the
government's response to the damage Hurricanes Irma and Maria caused in
September 2017.[^1] In the summer of 2018, local and federal officials
calculated that Hurricane Maria caused only sixty-four deaths in Puerto
Rico, while a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine
conservatively estimated that 4,645 people died as a direct or indirect
result of the storm.[^2] The disparity between the local
administration's death count and the professional study reveals an
official repudiation of Caribbean lives. President Trump's callous
gesture of tossing paper in towels at hurricane survivors in 2017
further embodies the governmental diminishment of human suffering,
especially since most residents were struggling without water or
power.[^3] Relief policies reflect the institutional disrespect for
citizens of U.S. possessions: St. Croix and Puerto Rico received less
aid more slowly than other states affected by 2017 hurricanes Irma and
Harvey in Texas and Florida, leaving impoverished populations on the
islands with fewer governmental resources than those on the mainland in
the aftermath of storms.[^4]

Across the hurricane zone, art converges with social justice activism as
a means for residents of the tropics to make their voices heard in the
public sphere. They have achieved some significant gains. In July 2019,
for example, Puerto Rican Governor Ricardo Rosselló resigned in the face
of massive demonstrations against his treatment of his fellow islanders.
Art and music were instrumental in channeling public outrage through
protest songs like "Sharpening the Knives" \["Afilando los cuchillos"\]
by Residente with iLe and Bad Bunny and "Ricky I Dumped You" \["Te Boté
Remix"\] by Casper, Nio García, Darell, Nicky Jam, Bad Bunny, and Ozuna.

Across the archipelago and the mainland, art and music have emerged as
key modes of refuting the discounting of vulnerable lives by the
government. As Marianne Ramírez Aponte, the director of the Museo de
Arte Contemporáneo de Puerto Rico, has written, art spaces are "sites of
ideological power and potential social agency and change" amid the storm
recovery.[^5] The most powerful contemporary art does not just call the
people to attention and action, however; it is action in itself, action
that reclaims, restores, and revalorizes Greater Caribbean lives and
landscapes. "Coasts in Crisis" is therefore not only an exhibit, but
also an action that brings art practices out of traditional museum
settings. In doing so, it seeks to establish alternatives to the
colonial paradigm of dependency on the United States and to feature
people of the Caribbean advocating for their own visions of the future
through art.

### Project Design and Description

{% include image.html 
    img="issue07/site-homepage.png"
    title="Three 2017 hurricane paths"
    caption="The homepage for Coasts in Crisis digital." 
    url="http://coastsincrisis.net/"
%}


The homepage of "Coasts in Crisis" digital features a map of the
Caribbean overlaid with the pathways of Hurricanes Maria, Irma, and
Jose, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association.
This design feature presents the website's navigational structure and
plays on the ubiquity of meteorological maps in storm tracking. The ways
these maps partition geography into a predetermined grid reveals a
persistence of colonial logic that hurricanes, with their unpredictable
paths, call into question. Cutting through the longitude and latitude
lines, the storms' routes destabilize the legacy of colonialism implicit
in cartography, a tension that we reconfigure by showcasing the
nonlinear aesthetics of Caribbean artistic expression in a flat and
linear digital form. Just as the unruliness of the hurricanes' cones of
uncertainty escapes scientific specificity, the Caribbean escapes linear
histories. In this way, "Coasts in Crisis" digital contributes to
ongoing discussions within Caribbean Digital Humanities that ask linear
digital forms to function in nonlinear ways, as shown by projects such
as Laura Vargas Zuleta's "[Hadriana in Context:
Timelines](http://archipelagosjournal.org/issue06/vargas-real-life.html),"
which uses Knight Lab timelines to articulate Caribbean temporalities.
To communicate this nonlinearity in our own project, we took the spiral
as an important feature of Caribbean life, from the shape of the
hurricane vortex to the amalgamation of histories and cultures in the
region. This geometry enables a theorization of the spiral as a sense of
repetition with difference, which we use as a governing aesthetic for
the site.

We interpret these storms as working in patterns, and the grid allows us
to place three separate trajectories from the 2017 hurricane
season---Maria, Irma, and Jose---in the same space, a counterpoint to
media that narrates hurricanes as exceptional events. Because they share
the same digital space on the site, we begin to see these storms as
interconnected both to each other and to human and non-human ecologies
across time in the Caribbean. With this project we can highlight, then,
a deeper, more-than-human history that reveals the increasing frequency
and intensity of these storms due to climate change. Each of these
storms speaks to its own specific contexts and localities and yet, when
brought together in this digital project, they become inflection points
stretching forward and backward in time. They extend beyond their
individual contexts to make the longer pattern of storms in the
Caribbean differently legible.

Navigation for the site relies on a design that invites user engagement
with the homepage. From an aesthetic standpoint, we elected to use a
gray and teal color palette; teal evokes the Caribbean Sea, while the
gray background allows us to showcase the featured artistic works
without distractions. The teal font and buttons show well against the
gray to make navigation readily visible. The spinning hurricane icons
cue users to hover the mouse over the map, which then brings buttons
into view for the three pathways on the site. The pathways---Entangled
Ecologies, Creative Resistance, and Predictable Precarity---correspond
to the three hurricane trajectories. These icons mimic the graphics used
in the media and also evoke the symbol of the Taino deity of storms,
*juracán*, whose spiral form proliferates in Indigenous arts of the
Americas.[^6] The icons thus indicate the continuity of hurricanes'
importance in human existence and incorporate something of the storms'
swirling motion into an otherwise static site. We would like to
incorporate more of this sense of movement into the site to continue
challenging linearity. When the buttons appear on the homepage, so too
do a series of dots along each hurricane path that visually represent
stops showcasing the artists' work along each pathway. When users hover
the mouse over the map, they activate the pathways as lines of critical
inquiry.

Like the Caribbean spiral, the site's three pathways destabilize the
conventional user experience. For one, their odd number resists the
balance of an even number of pathways and therefore extends the
project's interrogation of linearity in space and time. Through the
pathways, the site hands itself over to the user: in order to move
through the exhibit, the user must choose one of them. While designing
the homepage, we intentionally placed the pathway buttons so that none
would have primacy over the others. Each pathway therefore offers a
different opportunity to consider these storms as local iterations in a
larger pattern within the broader context of global climate change,
which results in more powerful and frequent storms. Placing the buttons
and hurricane icons posed a design challenge; we had to override the
theme with our own CSS to give them highly-customized locations on the
homepage. Even design choices as small as button placement raise
questions of how to represent the storms in a digital space.

Users' movement along the pathways also follows the spiral's repetition
with difference. We took our cues from the spiral by including buttons
on the bottom of each pathway stop that give the option to either
"Spiral Forward" or "Spiral Back." Here, we once again felt ourselves
pressing against digital linearity with the Caribbean spiral. Although
we give the option to move either backwards or forward along the
pathways, our project's questioning of linear time has its limits.
Moving backwards and forwards along a timeline ultimately confines
navigation to a bidirectional movement that is visually similar to a
line's. To this end, we wonder how we might incorporate unpredictability
more thoroughly into the pathways. What, for example, would a pathway
look like in a more circular trajectory? Something of the interaction
between the line and the circle in the spiral form shows through in how
each pathway end returns the user back to the homepage to select a new
pathway. Users return to the homepage with a difference; they have now
seen the artistic expressions on one pathway and bring this knowledge
forward to another pathway or to sites beyond our project. In this way,
the homepage becomes uncanny, both familiar and strange. This tension of
similarity and difference extends across and between the pathways. Their
lines of critical inquiry work relationally, following Glissant's
*Poetics of Relation*, as concepts, motifs, and the works of particular
artists appear in more than one pathway.

The artwork evokes some of the sensory panorama of the hurricane, even
in the flat digital realm, throughout the pathway stops. Each stop has
its own title corresponding to the artists' work on the page. The work
ranges from photographs of visual art and installations to poetry,
music, and Santos-Negrón's recording of Hurricane Maria. On each page,
our priority was to maintain the integrity of the featured art to the
best of our ability in this remediation through careful design
decisions. To this end, we borrowed features used in physical museums,
such as the curatorial shadowbox that sets off text belonging to each
piece, to limit our intrusion on the work and to gesture towards the
experiential qualities of our project. That said, we continue to
consider the layout for the pages in order to maximize aesthetic appeal
and user facility in balance with the display requirements for each
piece of art. Some of the work on the site posed challenges here; for
instance, it is difficult to translate the more tactile qualities,
whether the jagged edges of recycled objects or the physical
manipulation of tarot cards, into a digital space. Nevertheless, some of
our design choices attempt to communicate this sense of manual craft, as
shown by the typeset we used to display Nicole Delgado's poetry.

{% include image.html

    title="*Las casas vacías*"
    caption="Delgado, Nicole. Screenshot of the poem as it appears on the site. Puerto Rico."
    url="http://coastsincrisis.net/ageofabandonment"
%}

We hope, too, that the individual care we gave each piece of art in its
placement on the page is evident. The pages also include audio from
interviews with the featured artists featured. Because Drupal is such a
heavy content management system, we decided to outsource the hosting of
these audio files to YouTube and then embed the videos into each page.

### Credit and Preservation Concerns

For the creation of *Coasts* digital, Charlotte Rogers procured funding
from the Center for Global Inquiry and Innovation at UVa to support
hosting costs and the paid work of graduate students Rebecca Elise Foote
and Winnie E. Pérez Martínez, which included site design,
implementation, and curation. The design team would like to thank the
staff of UVa's Scholars' Lab, especially Jeremy Boggs and Ammon Shepard,
for their patience, time, and support. Professor Rogers thanks graduate
students Elise and Winnie for their dedication and insightful
contributions to the project on top of their coursework and dissertation
writing. All three of the site's creators thank the seven Greater
Caribbean artists for their commitment to the project over the past two
years and for allowing their work to be displayed on the site. Lastly,
special thanks to Caroline Whitcomb, the event coordinator, for her
continued support and planning during the artist gathering and the
digital project launch. As the funding from UVa winds down, we seek a
reasonably durable future for the project.

In addition to meeting the scholarly standards we have set for the
project, we also aim for it to remain viable and reachable beyond our
respective involvements with its development. In the article "The
Directory Paradox," Quinn Dombrowski underscores the challenges and
difficulties that plague the reality of keeping a digital humanities
project alive over a long period of time.[^7] Access to sufficient time,
labor (paid or not), and recurrent funds constitute salient high-risk
factors that can either consolidate the existence of a project or, as
more often happens, place an expiration date on the lives of hundreds of
digital endeavors despite creators' and collaborators' intentions.
Dombrowski's eloquent cautionary tale pushed us to reconsider our
project goals and priorities to guarantee longevity for *Coasts*.

To carve a future for "Coasts in Crisis", we evaluated the site
infrastructure and developed a plan to migrate and transition its
components into a framework and hosting environment better suited to its
needs and to our long-term goals for the project. Our parameters for the
post-launch examination of the site centered around maintenance, how
Caribbean users engage with the Internet, and the preservation of
*Coasts* as an art exhibition website that challenges the linear and
hierarchical understanding of experiencing a hurricane. Experiencing the
site through this assessment allowed us to identify an urgent need to
migrate the site and to change our hosting as well as domain services.

At present, the site runs on a privately-owned domain name with low but
recurrent renewal and shared-hosting costs through Reclaim Hosting.
While the expenditures and manual maintenance are low, they do require
consistent periodic labor, funds to ensure the stable online presence of
the site, and someone to pay these funds. In our next iteration, we plan
to move from Reclaim Hosting to GitHub Pages because it offers a free
hosting service that includes a second-level domain. This transition
will eliminate any need of finding funds and remembering to renew both
the hosting and domain services. *Coasts* will be able to operate and
remain stable regardless of changes in its development and
administration team. By hosting the exhibition's files on GitHub, we
allow the possibility for future interested individuals to contribute,
expand, or re-imagine the project. Through this process, *Coasts* gains
a durable status that provides opportunities for its growth without the
need for hands-on updates from its creators and caretakers.

Similar preservation and access concerns surfaced during the development
stage. We used the popular CMS platform, Drupal, which spurred us to
consider whether alternative frameworks would be more conducive to our
goals. Primarily, we want to make sure that users with low-bandwidth
internet connections can access the website and that the development
learning curve will not be too steep for those who might want to work on
the project, but who do not have a background in development. Initially,
we considered using Omeka or Wax, but we thought it would be easier to
produce a highly-customized design and site structure in Drupal. With
its robust user and developer community, Drupal already had plenty of
online forums to help with troubleshooting inquiries and optimizing our
interface.

In practice, Drupal caused many problems, including pushing back the
launch date for "Coasts in Crisis" digital. Its decentralized handling
of HTML through its TWIG-based template system turns adding and editing
CSS rules into an involved process for beginners. Likewise, its variety
of components complicate the process of styling and properly structuring
the content elements of our site, which is especially trying for
troubleshooting. Drupal's automatic update option broke our site twice,
forcing us to resort to manual updates. At first, we did not realize
this was the issue because by default, Drupal's PHP and scripts do not
provide verbose error messages unless they are manually indicated to do
so. This feature proved a major setback in our development process since
we had to troubleshoot blindly before we managed to turn on the setting
to display detailed error messages. Lastly, one of our ongoing concerns
is the server-heavy components that make the CMS versatile but that also
hinder the speed with which the site can be visited and developed. It
requires users to have a stable internet connection to guarantee access.
These difficulties proved that in order for the project to work as
intended and to increase its chance of success, our best option was to
move away from Drupal. Nevertheless, this experience with Drupal helped
us grow as digital humanists and improved our ability to scope the needs
of similar digital projects.

### Future Steps and Expectations for Sustainability in Caribbean DH

Our interest in grappling with the experience of hurricanes in the
Caribbean necessarily leads us to confront the issue of sustainability
in the region's infrastructures. We aim to make the academic and
artistic collaboration that is "Coasts in Crisis" widely accessible.
Often, strong internet connections and services are not guaranteed in
the Caribbean. Intermittent access to the Internet and frequently
interrupted electric service, if available at all, leads Caribbean users
to rely heavily on mobile devices to stay connected. These devices
require less electric charge and have access to mobile Internet
networks, however unstable their connections may be. Further, purchasing
a smartphone that can connect to the web and carry out many of a
computer's functionalities costs less than acquiring both a phone and a
computer, especially since people can buy phones secondhand or exchange
them.[^8] With this in mind, we restrained our search for a Drupal
alternative to light frameworks and static site generators that require
minimal upkeep and, most importantly, that can run on spotty internet
connections.

Our decision to turn to a lighter framework draws on the work done by
the Global Outlook in the Digital Humanities collaborative group,
especially their concept of minimal computing. This concept contours a
set of flexible practical principles to scope and carry out
conscientious digital projects tailored to a specific technical,
cultural, and academic context. Both Alex Gil and Élika Ortega advocate
for its implementation using the following characteristics: "ease of
use, ease of creation, increased access, and reductions in computing -
and by extension, electricity." [^9]Thinking of our project's goals and
our intended audience with attention to minimal computing, we
reconsidered the current state of our project and discussed an overhaul
of our technical conditions to improve the site and to extend its
accessibility.

In consultation with the technologists at the University of Virginia's
Scholars' Lab, we decided that migrating our site from Drupal to Jekyll
would be the best course of action to support access and sustainability
of the digital exhibition. Jekyll is a static site generator with a
large community of users that has gained popularity within the DH
community in the last few years. While Jekyll lacks a sophisticated
admin to create user accounts or a collaborator panel to generate, edit,
and publish new content, it uses Markdown to simplify adding content
directly to pure HTML. Moreover, since the project has a small dataset
and few development needs, the different levels of user access that
Drupal offers goes beyond the technical needs of a small project like
ours. Rather than downscaling, our move away from Drupal and into Jekyll
allows us to use a platform better suited to the needs of a small scale
DH project with a bespoke and ambitious design.

We plan to abide by the principles of mobile-first development to
provide a simpler version of the site that accurately conveys the
questions and conversations from both the in-person event and the
large-screen website on phones and similar devices during the migration
and optimization process. As part of this major revision, we will work
on creating and uploading project documentation on our GitHub repository
to provide a centralized account of our rationale that includes
step-by-step guides for the more complicated portions of the project.
Documentation is a vital yet frequently overlooked and tedious portion
of responsible development; arguably, it is one of, if not the most,
important output generated as part of a project because it is crucial to
the project data's longevity.[^10] As each of the original creators and
collaborators move on to other endeavors, we want to leave an
independent project with detailed and thorough documentation that can
enable anyone who is interested in the project to expand or modify our
work. We believe that "Coasts in Crisis" will be ready to exist
sustainably upon completion of these discussed changes. It will gain
independence from the labor of its creators while possessing the
necessary components to grow and support discussions about digital
humanities work in Caribbean Studies.

As it stands, "Coasts in Crisis" still has a long way to go to reach our
initial vision, but its current form nevertheless offers a free and
public glimpse into the work and perspectives of artists who lived
through the 2017 hurricanes. As a critical curatorial initiative,
*Coasts* transforms an ephemeral gathering of artists into an online
exhibition that both guides and misguides users in an approximation of
the confusion experienced when living through a hurricane and its
aftermath. In our ideal version of the project, we planned to provide an
immersive, interactive, visual and aural experience that could capture a
snapshot of hurricane survivors' feelings and reactions. Creating a
customized, spiral-inspired interface for the artwork seemed like the
most straightforward approach to reach our goal, but engaging with this
multidirectional shape proved to be a daunting albeit generative
challenge. Mimicking the spiral movement of hurricanes, we have come to
learn, functions as a line of critical inquiry in its own right rather
than simply a display format.

Along with using the site as a way to disorient and expose visitors to
hurricanes through art, we planned to include brief insights from the
artists gathered during the event. Although we have added links to their
interviews on YouTube, we believe there are still other ways to state
the connection between artists and the rationale behind their art more
directly. We are currently grappling with what these other ways might
mean and the forms they could take. It was similarly complex for us to
arrange and introduce the artwork to follow the spiral shape. At
present, we are unsure if we can continue pursuing the spiral form in
the future iteration of our exhibit, but there are a few other goals
that remain feasible and important additions to the site. In *Coasts*'
current state, there exists no mobile-friendly version of the site.
Further, the site was not developed following best practices for
accessibility. This is a crucial dimension of the project that we will
incorporate in future versions. In this case, the question of
accessibility poses a crucial challenge: how to remain true to the
customized and deliberately nonlinear design of the site while making it
open to the widest audience possible?

In the five years that have passed since the 2017 hurricane season,
Santos-Negrón's mother's home has been razed and rebuilt. New growth is
visible in the Yunque Forest, but many native, centuries-old trees are
gone forever. Blue tarps remain and now even replace roofs across much
of St. Croix. The coquí song has returned to Puerto Rico, but thousands
of people displaced after the storm have not, including Jo Cosme, one of
the artists featured on this site. As Hurricanes Irma and Maria recede
with each new hurricane season, art remains to bear witness to the
living and the dead, and to call attention to the injustice of local and
global responses to Caribbean disasters. Cosme's deck of tarot cards,
"Crónicas de un futuro catastrófico" narrates a litany of corruption,
disaster capitalism, and official disregard for Caribbean life after the
storms that reveals the injustice in disaster responses. Cosme's
photography series "Welcome to Paradise" takes on new resonance as
wealthy investors from outside the archipelago purchase second homes
while living costs become untenable for Caribbean residents.

    title="Welcome to Paradise I"
    caption="Cosme, Jo. Puerto Rico, 2017."
%}

The digital iteration of "Coasts in Crisis" aims to endure long after
the glare of media attention has turned its gaze elsewhere. As time
passes, the meanings of these images, recordings, and interviews will
change as the visitors to the site reflect on the latest hurricane
season. We might remember that before Hurricane Maria, David Berg often
photographed a silk-cotton tree that stood sentinel for centuries, a
tree whose witnessing reached back to the horrors of enslavement. After
the storm, Berg photographed this same tree felled by the wind, and the
swath of open sky once filled by its branches in his "Regrowth" series.
Our project points, time and again, to these empty spaces that still
linger, and it offers a testament to regeneration.

## *archipelagos* Review of Coasts in Crisis

### Contribution

How can art help people navigate the revelations and transformations
brought about by climate disaster? Coasts in Crisis explores this
question through a digital exhibition of music, photography, poetry,
installations, and visual art created in the aftermath of the 2017
hurricane season. The project is organized around three thematic
sections; each section brings together the work of artists based in
different locations and working with different media, as well as
interviews with the artists and interpretive text.

The thematic organization of the materials encourages audiences to think
about connections and shared experiences across the Caribbean, rather
than isolated case studies centered on individual islands or individual
hurricanes. At the same time, however, the project could pay closer
attention to the geography it maps out. The homepage states that the
project is about the Greater Caribbean. The artwork, indeed, speaks to
experiences in St. Croix, Puerto Rico, and the Florida Keys. Yet, when
considered in relation to each other, these places speak to a particular
geography within the Greater Caribbean---all three are territories under
U.S. rule. Within the context of this project, what is gained and what
is lost when these connections produced by U.S. empire remain detectable
but unacknowledged?

Further observations emerge from the project's geographical positioning.
The curatorial text opening the Entangled Ecologies section states that
"these works reveal to us that the lives and landscapes of Puerto Rico
are deeply and beautifully entangled." Yet the section also features
photographs taken in St. Croix, which is not part of the Puerto Rico
archipelago.

The regional dimensions of the project also invite questions about
existing and potential audiences. Among the six artists whose work is
showcased, four are from Puerto Rico. The curatorial text is in English.
Given how Puerto Rican art features so prominently, are there plans to
make the project more accessible to Spanish-speaking audiences? Four
artist interviews are in Spanish, while two are in English. Are there
plans to provide bilingual transcriptions or subtitles?

The author's project statement declares that by bringing art out of
museums into a digital space, "it seeks to establish alternatives to the
colonial pattern of dependency on the United States." While the art and
interviews do center Caribbean voices, it is unclear how the digital
format of the project disrupts colonial dependency on the United States,
especially considering the location and source of the project's funding,
labor, and institutional support. It would be helpful for the authors to
identify the specific forms of dependency that the project runs the risk
of reproducing, or that the project wishes to challenge, and discuss the
measures they have taken to do digital humanities otherwise. For
example, how does the project, through its processes or digital format,
address power asymmetries between artists and audiences based in the
Caribbean and the host institution based in the United States? How might
it contribute to local forms of autonomy in Puerto Rico, St. Croix, and
the Florida Keys? Or how does the project otherwise conceptualize and
challenge dependency?

### Credit

The project has a dedicated page crediting the artists and project team
with photos, short biographies, and descriptions of project roles for
each contributor, including students. A resources page cites relevant
digital humanities and scholarly works. With respect to the interviews,
audiences might want to know who conducted them and under what
circumstances.

### Design

The project's design adds another layer of complexity to the exhibition
materials by exploring the tension between colonial projects and
Caribbean forces, both human and natural. This tension manifests
visually through the grid of latitude and longitude lines that
constitute the background for the map on the home page, on one hand, and
the hurricane pathways that wind across the map, on the other hand. While the grid represents colonial efforts to make the Caribbean
legible, the hurricane paths---each of which represent one of the three
thematic sections---reference the uncontrollable nature of Caribbean
expressions generated by artists as well as storms. The design guides
audience engagement with this tension through the spiral motif that ties
the exhibition together. Visually, the motif manifests in the hurricane
icons for each pathway. The spiral also guides the audience journey
through the exhibition, as each thematic section in the end loops back
to the homepage, where audiences may select another pathway. This design
strategy is effective in that it encourages audiences to consider
similarities and differences across locations and specific hurricanes,
thus disrupting linear configurations of space and time represented by
the cartographic grid.

Although the spiral subverts the colonial map, some of the other visual
elements generate questions about the fit between the map and the
exhibition's content and aims. To what extent does the map show the
Greater Caribbean evoked in the artwork? The map shows the arc of
Caribbean islands from Cuba and the Bahamas to Trinidad and Tobago, yet
does not show the Florida Keys, where some of the featured art was
produced. Neither is it clear why some islands or countries are shaded
in dark grey, while others are light grey. The grid in the background,
while it evokes latitude and longitude lines, does not accurately
represent these measures. Audiences might also be curious about the dots
that mark each hurricane pathway. While the dots convey how the journey
through each thematic pathway consists of several stops, the number of
dots does not match up with the number of stops that mark each journey.

While the artist interviews are embedded on the website, links to other
sound files and external resources should open in a separate window.

### Preservation

With the long-term life of the project in mind, the authors plan to move
the site from the private domain name on Reclaim Hosting to GitHub
Pages. As a small-scale digital project with few development needs, they
also plan to overhaul the project so that it better aligns with the
concept of minimal computing by migrating the site from Drupal to
Jekyll. Part of this overhaul involves the development of a mobile
version of the website with plans to upload documentation to the GitHub
repository.

## Response to *archipelagos* review of "Coasts in Crisis" by Rebecca Elise Foote, Winnie Pérez Martínez, and Charlotte Rogers

We thank the reviewer/s for this rigorous and precise review of "Coasts
in Crisis." The queries regarding the implicit role of U.S. empire in
this project and our own positionality helped us reflect on our
motivations as well as those of our home institution. We now address
these issues explicitly in the second half of the "About" page of the
site. "Coasts in Crisis" was funded by the University of Virginia, an
educational institution located on unceded Monacan lands and originally
constructed with enslaved labor. The University's founder, Thomas
Jefferson, sought to isolate and impoverish Haiti after it liberated
itself from French imperial control in 1804. As contemporary members of
UVA's academic community, we recognize our university's role in U.S.
attempts to marginalize and indebt the nations and peoples of the
Caribbean. These power asymmetries linger in our economic and
infrastructural capacity to host events and secure payment for the
artists and the student workers. The project aims to take a step towards
redressing that unequal situation by elevating the work and voices of
artists and students who live under the ongoing shadow of U.S.
colonialism and those whose families emigrated from the Caribbean and
Latin America to the United States.

Acknowledging these local roots of U.S. imperialism within the Caribbean
offers an enriched sense of how the United States remains complicit in
the perpetuation of power imbalances that exacerbate the vulnerability
of archipelagos to hurricane damage. More broadly, the increasing
frequency and severity of the storms show how anthropogenic climate
change, spurred in no small part by the fossil fuel consumption inherent
in global capitalism, compounds the ongoing disaster of coloniality. The
continuing extraction of wealth from these territories in the forms of
debt, taxes, and unsustainable coastal construction renders the islands'
frail social and physical infrastructures even more precarious. Lastly,
this connection highlights the disparity in governmental aid for
hurricane zones in the continental United States in contrast to the U.S.
territories in the Caribbean.

We aim to counteract patterns of dependency by educating our
increasingly diverse academic community and creating opportunities for
artists to connect across islands and continents. The dual purpose of
the original 2019 "Coasts in Crisis" event was to educate the UVA
community about the role of art in responding to hurricanes in the
Greater Caribbean and to create a sense of belonging and visibility for
the Hispanic and Caribbean communities that are growing within this
predominately white institution. Now, more than three years after the
event, the artists remain in contact with each other. Just as the
artists at the event only connected through the gathering at the
University of Virginia, the site offers an opportunity for its users to
"meet" the artists and their work by moving through the site. The
original objectives informed the selection of collaborators on the site:
our graduate student web designers, Winnie Pérez-Martínez and Rebecca
Elise Foote, identify as Puerto Rican and Chicana, respectively, and
bring their own experiences with the 2017 hurricane season to this
project. The graduate students who conducted the interviews with the
artists are of Latinx, Puerto Rican, and white heritage. The digital
iteration of the project aspires to be accessible to a broader
archipelagic and continental public, especially as the geoformal
distinctions between them are eroded by climate change's rising seas and
more powerful and frequent hurricanes.

Regarding the benefit of the project to the artists themselves, we
articulate the project's aims as follows:

1.  To amplify the work of Caribbean artists living in precarious
    communities after the 2017 hurricane season

2.  To establish opportunities for intercontinental and archipelagic
    connections facilitated by artistic engagement

3.  To begin an ongoing conversation on the relationship between art,
    disaster, and coloniality

We have made several revisions to the site in light of the reviewer's
generous and substantive feedback on the site's design and navigation.
We have revised the text for the opening page of "Entangled Ecologies"
to reflect that the islands of St. Croix and Puerto Rico are explored in
this pathway. In line with the reviewers' suggestions, we added the
Florida Keys to the map on the home page, removed the black dots on the
hurricane pathways, changed the background color of all islands to
black, and modified all external links so that they open in a new window
when clicked.

The site's main navigation image, a stylized re-imagining of the NOAA
hurricane map, serves an important interactive purpose for site
visitors. One of the drawbacks to this approach is that it makes
superimposing the main navigation map on the correct latitude and
longitude lines very difficult because it requires designing from
scratch an accurately scaled map of the distance and sizes of all
islands in the archipelagos' image and grid background image, none of
which we could find readily available online. Instead of focusing on an
accurately scaled representation of the region, we uploaded an image
evoking the grid format as a nod to the map that inspired the design.

Regarding translations, one of the original goals of the project was to
create a multilingual site reflecting the linguistic diversity of the
Caribbean. The relationship between Spanish-speaking Caribbean audiences
and the English-dominated spaces of academic inquiry is complex and
riddled with colonial tensions. Our critical understanding of such a
relationship led us to mark Spanish translations a key component in our
initial plans to build the Coasts in Crisis site. We decided to publish
Coasts in English first, understanding the ethical limitations of this
approach, because all of the collaborators shared it as a *lingua
franca*. At the time, we did not have a clear grasp of how much time it
would take for us, as first-time Drupal users, to thoroughly complete
our full vision for Coasts.

There is, perhaps, a relatively simple method for adding automated
translations to our site, but the cost of implementing it, in the long
run, outweighs its immediate benefits for our particular context. Drupal
has four core dedicated modules for managing a multilingual website, but we avoided this approach based on our preservation plan. In the summer of 2023 we will migrate the digital exhibit from Drupal 9.5.4 to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a popular static site
generator (or SSG). Jekyll will allow Coasts to live on in a stable,
low-maintenance environment hosted by GitHub Pages. Within this context,
installing and troubleshooting Drupal's four core multilingual modules
poses two conflicts. First, Jekyll's pragmatic approach to web
publishing lacks the complexity to integrate Drupal's multi-module
process. The second complication stems from this feature divergence: all
the labor required to install and troubleshoot the modules, before
producing any translations, would be entirely lost in the migration
process to re-home Coasts in a Jekyll site. At present, this context
prevents us from including Spanish translations on the site.

We have revised our preservation plan with the help of Jeremy Boggs, the
Head of Research and Development at the Scholar's Lab at UVA, and plan
to complete the migration by July 10th, 2023. Winnie Pérez Martínez has
volunteered to be in charge of the migration and the documentation
writing. Unfortunately, at this time we lack the resources to produce a
stable mobile version of the site, but we do not discard the possibility
of making one in the future.
