  "Remembering the Middle Passage" is a collective of scholars using digital humanities tools to represent, and possibly memorialize, enslaved Africans who died along the Middle Passage. Taking up Jessica Marie Johnson's call for a "Black digital practice," or methods that "challenge reproduction of black death and commodification, countering the presumed neutrality of the digital" (Johnson, 2018), our project seeks to map discrete deaths in a way that centers personal subjectivities and the communal bonds severed by these deaths. Our early efforts, as seen on our website, used ArcGIS technology to chart the 1757 slaving voyage of the *Good Hope*, marking places at sea where individuals died, as deduced from the geocoordinates in the ship's logbook. In this article, we reflect on these initial attempts at mapping, critiquing our reliance on presumably neutral geospatial technologies, finding them to be rooted in persisting colonial cartographic practices. Despite our intentions to disaggregate archival data and to re-center, through our design choices, the human lives lost, mapping proved a blunt instrument for our purposes. On our website, we made use of critical fabulation, as theorized by Saidiya Hartman, to trouble the flatness of the map and to use the subjunctive mood to imagine the lives obscured by coordinates. In our article, we explore the consequences of using critical fabulation in the digital realm. Whereas previous examples of critical fabulation, including Hartman's own, have engaged with print archives such as legal records and newspaper reports, we ask in this article what it means to "digitize" the toolset of critical fabulation, applying its methods, in particular, to geospatial data. Bringing critical fabulation into the digital archive opens up new possibilities for both critical fabulation and Black digital practice, enabling us to better grapple with mundane, everyday, and otherwise unpublicized (and therefore unprinted) violence in the archive of slavery.

  « Remembering the Middle Passage » est un collectif d'universitaires engagés dans l'utilisation des outils des humanités numériques pour représenter, et peut-être commémorer, les Africains réduits en esclavage qui sont morts le long de la Traversée du Milieu. Reprenant l'appel de Jessica Marie Johnson pour une "pratique numérique noire", ou des méthodes qui "défient la reproduction de la mort et de la marchandisation des Noirs, contrecarrant la neutralité présumée du numérique » (Johnson 2018), notre projet cherche à cartographier les décès discrets d'une manière qui centre les subjectivités personnelles et les liens communautaires rompus par ces morts. Nos premiers efforts, comme on le voit sur notre site Web, ont été concernés par l'utilisation de la technologie ArcGIS pour cartographier le voyage d'esclavage de 1757 du Good Hope, marquant des lieux en mer où des individus sont morts, déduits des coordonnées géographiques du navire registre. Dépassant et réfléchissant sur ces premières tentatives de cartographie, cet article critique notre recours à des technologies géospatiales présumées neutres, les trouvant ancrées dans des pratiques cartographiques coloniales persistantes. Malgré nos intentions de désagréger les données d'archives et de recentrer, à travers nos choix de conception, les vies humaines perdues, la cartographie s'est avérée un instrument contondant pour nos objectifs. Le site Web a utilisé la fabulation critique, telle que théorisée par Saidiya Hartman, pour troubler la planéité de la carte et pour imaginer sur un mode subjonctif les vies obscurcies par les coordonnées. L'article va explorer davantage les conséquences de l'utilisation de la fabulation critique dans le domaine numérique. Alors que le précédent des exemples de fabulation critique, y compris celle de Hartman, se sont engagés dans des archives imprimées telles que dossiers juridiques et articles de journaux, l'article demande ce que signifie « numériser » l'ensemble d'outils de fabulation, appliquant ses méthodes notamment aux données géospatiales. Faire entrer la fabulation critique dans les archives numériques, selon nous, ouvrent de nouvelles possibilités à la fois pour la fabulation critique et les pratiques numériques « noires », nous permettant de mieux lutter contre la violence banale, quotidienne et autrement non publicisée (et donc non imprimée) dans les archives de l'esclavage.

  "Recordando el pasaje del medio" es un colectivo de académicos que utilizan herramientas de humanidades digitales para representar, y posiblemente conmemorar, a los africanos esclavizados que murieron a lo largo del pasaje del medio. Retomando el llamado de Jessica Marie Johnson a una "práctica digital negra" o métodos que "desafíen la reproducción y la mercantilización de la muerte negra, contrarrestando la supuesta neutralidad de lo digital" (Johnson, 2018), nuestro proyecto busca mapear muertes discretas de una manera que centra las subjetividades personales y los lazos comunales cortados por estas muertes. Nuestros primeros esfuerzos, como se ve en nuestro sitio web, utilizaron tecnología ArcGIS para trazar el viaje de esclavos de 1757 del navío *Good Hope*, marcando lugares en el mar donde personas murieron, como se deduce de las coordenadas geográficas en el diario de a bordo. En este artículo, reflexionamos sobre estas aproximaciones cartográficas iniciales, criticando nuestra propia dependencia en las tecnologías geoespaciales supuestamente neutrales, encontrando que estas están arraigadas en prácticas cartográficas coloniales persistentes. A pesar de nuestras intenciones de desagregar los datos de archivo y volver a centrar, a través de nuestras elecciones de diseño, las vidas humanas perdidas, el mapeo demostró ser un instrumento contundente para nuestros propósitos. En nuestro sitio web, hicimos uso de la fabulación crítica, según la teoría de Saidiya Hartman, para perturbar la planitud del mapa y usar el modo subjuntivo para imaginar las vidas oscurecidas por las coordenadas. En nuestro artículo, exploramos las consecuencias del uso de la fabulación crítica en el ámbito digital. Mientras que ejemplos anteriores del uso de la fabulación crítica, incluyendo los de la misma Hartman, se han relacionado con archivos impresos, como registros legales o informes periodísticos, en este artículo nos preguntamos qué significa "digitalizar" el conjunto de herramientas de la fabulación crítica, aplicando sus métodos, en particular, a datos geoespaciales. Llevar la fabulación crítica al archivo digital abre nuevas posibilidades tanto para la fabulación crítica como para la práctica digital negra, permitiéndonos lidiar mejor con la violencia mundana, cotidiana y no publicitada (y por lo tanto no impresa) en el archivo de la esclavitud.

## 1. Introduction: Measurements, Maps, and Memory at Sea

At approximately 3:00 AM on the morning of May 11, 1757, on an otherwise
normal sailing day, a small boy died of flux while on board the slave
ship the *Good Hope*. By the time of the boy's death, the wind had risen
to the level of a "fresh breeze" and the air around the ship was
"hazy."[^1] The *Good Hope* was then in the middle of the Atlantic
Ocean, at latitude 10.75 and longitude -32.95, two weeks into a voyage
from Bunce Island, Sierra Leone to the slave markets of St. Kitts.

The event was deplorable but not singular. The small boy who died
at 10.75 by -32.95 in May 1757 was one of more than 1.8 million captive
Africans who died along the Middle Passage. The unceremonious disposal
of his body in the Atlantic, marked by nothing more than an entry in a
logbook, is one of a vast number of such events, very few of which have
ever been geolocated. For decades, scholars have added up such deaths,
trying to determine the total mortality of the Middle Passage by piecing
together traces gleaned from logs, registers, and bills of sale. Such
cumulative efforts have been crucial to the world's understanding of the
cataclysmic nature of the transatlantic slave trade, but they have left
individual deaths largely unmourned.

Scholars of slavery have long acknowledged the methodological difficulty
and moral paradox posed by their reliance on an archive "fundamentally
marked by ... a profound, irreparable violence."[^2] Indeed, historians'
calculations of mass mortality in the Middle Passage often and
unavoidably depend on statistical data generated by enslavers themselves
in their attempts to control and discipline enslaved subjects.[^3]
Caitlin Rosenthal, for example, shows how enslavers used accounting
practices, and other quantitative management methods, to brutally
extract increasing sums of labor from enslaved Africans. As she argues,
"precise management and violence went hand in hand ... on plantations,
the soft power of quantification supplemented the driving force of the
whip."[^4] Likewise, Jessica Marie Johnson sees "the rise of the
independent and objective statistical fact as an explanatory ideal
\[as\] party to the devastating thingification of black women, children,
and men."[^5] Unsettling as the similarity might be, there is a way in
which historians' calculations of mass mortality in the Middle Passage,
while generated to demonstrate the horrific enormity of the event, not
only draw upon, but also resemble enslavers\' calculations of their
human cargo. Both calculations arguably rely on a process that reduces
personhood to something only meaningful as part of an aggregate---in the
case of the slave ship, a full complement of human cargo composed of a
set quantity of *pieza de India*.[^6]

Recognizing this, some digital humanists have attempted to reckon with
the violence of slavery's archive and the moral ambiguity of numerical
data within it. Digital humanities projects such as the [Early Caribbean Digital Archive](https://ecda.northeastern.edu/), [Mapping Marronage](http://mapping-marronage.rll.lsa.umich.edu/welcome), [(Un)silencing Slavery](https://unsilencing-slavery.org/), [Slave Revolt in Jamaica](http://revolt.axismaps.com/),
and [Musical Passage](http://www.musicalpassage.org/),
to name only a few of many, seek to subvert the violence of the archive
by remediating and remixing datapoints in different ways. Ultimately,
these works seek to use digital methods to illuminate both the everyday
and exceptional life practices of enslaved persons and communities
otherwise obscured in the analog archive of slavery---e.g., networks of
exchange, strategies of revolt and resistance, Black vernacular creative
work, etc. Collectively, these projects and the scholars who reflect on
them form part of the emerging field of Black Digital Humanities, the
radical and interdisciplinary ethos of which has provided a touchstone
for our own work.[^7]

Expanding on the above-mentioned projects, "Remembering the Middle
Passage" is an attempt to begin the difficult but urgent work of
mourning lives lost along the Middle Passage in digital space. A digital
humanities project based out of Duke University from c. 2019-2022,
"Remembering the Middle Passage" brought together undergraduate and
graduate students, faculty, and librarians from five disciplines and
three institutions interested in this question: how can we use digital
tools to represent, and possibly memorialize, enslaved Africans who died
along the Middle Passage? The major outcomes of this project are published on our website, [Remembering the Middle Passage](http://rememberingthemiddlepassage.com/), and
include both a map of where individuals' deaths occurred along the
voyage of the slave ship the *Good Hope* in 1757, as well as a
speculative retelling of one of those individual's life story. While
interest in maps has been a consistent preoccupation of Middle Passage
scholarship, as seen most recently in essays by Jamila Moore Pewu and
others in *The Digital Black Atlantic*, there exist markedly few maps of
the Middle Passage---and those that do exist, e.g., those generated from
the *Slave Voyages Database*, mostly portray broad navigational trends
across aggregated slaving voyages.[^8] Our project is the first to map
where individual deaths occurred along a single voyage and, indeed, one
of the first to attempt to map Middle Passage mortality in any
capacity.[^9]

In what follows, we look back on our mapping efforts over the past three
years, reflecting on both the limitations and intellectual-creative
possibilities of geospatial and DH methodologies in representing Middle
Passage mortality. Throughout, we consider the tension between
aggregation and disaggregation, collective and individual experience,
and make an argument for the (hermeneutical and ethical) value of
*disaggregation* as a way to bear witness to the human toll of the
Middle Passage. Digitally mapping individual deaths along a single slave
voyage, we suggest, gave us an important and new perspective on these
deaths; however, it was also a perspective beset with the legacies and
logics of colonial cartographic practices. Visually rendering where in
the Atlantic Ocean these deaths occurred led us to speculate about the
individual persons behind, and in some sense obscured by, the markers on
our map. Inspired by the work of scholar Saidiya Hartman, we decided to
attempt a "critical fabulation" of one of those person's life
experiences. In the penultimate section, we reflect on the intellectual
and creative gains afforded by combining critical fabulation and digital
humanities methodologies, attending to how these methodologies can
augment each other by opening up more meaningful and intentional ways of
interfacing with slavery's archive.

## 2. The Case for Disaggregation

Beginning with the work of economic historians such as Philip Curtin,
scholarship on the transatlantic slave trade has sought to tell the
story of the Middle Passage through its scale. In many cases, the
numerical statistics that these scholars draw from take on a narrative
power that obscures the human agents who are represented by and
responsible for the numbers.[^10] To be sure, motivating much of this
work is a keen desire to reckon with the massive loss of human life and
human suffering occasioned by the Middle Passage. In the twenty-first
century, these census-like statistics have provided the source data for
a number of digital projects that implicitly argue for the historical
and ongoing significance of Middle Passage atrocities through
spectacular visual deployments of this mass of data. The [Slave Voyages Database](https://www.slavevoyages.org/), for example, has amassed digital records (in tables, timelines, maps, etc.)
for over 36,000 slave voyages by which over 12 million enslaved Africans
were taken from their home continent and almost 2 million perished at
sea. Similarly, ["The Atlantic Slave Trade in Two
Minutes"](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/09/atlantic-slave-trade-history-animated-interactive.html)
(Kahn and Bouie) animates the comings and goings of over 20,000 slave
ships between 1545 and 1860 overlaid on a map of the Atlantic in a mere
120 seconds.

In its early stages, "Remembering the Middle Passage" worked towards
similar goals, analyzing the tens of thousands of overlapping routes in
the *Slave Voyages* database in an attempt to situate areas in the
Atlantic with the highest density of mortality. We believed that these
large datasets might provide specific GIS points where enslaved people
died and thus help us in our overall purpose of site-based
memorialization. We limited our search to British voyages, whose records
would be in English, that were cross-listed in both the *Slave Voyages*
and [CLIWOC](https://www.historicalclimatology.com/cliwoc.html)
(Climatological Database of the World's Oceans), as
CLIWOC provided geocoordinates. By cross-referencing these datasets, we
hoped to use the advantages of mass data for the purposes of locating
individuals' places of death. In this way, we sought to acknowledge the
reality and validity of personal tragedy both through and against "big
data"-based narratives of genocide and crimes against humanity.[^11]
Although we believed several of these slave voyages were in both
databases and could therefore be mapped, our efforts were frustrated by
the aggregative structure of the *Slave Voyages* and CLIWOC databases,
which either do not contain the necessary geocoordinates (*Slave
Voyages*) or do not distinguish between individual voyages that might
have shared the same name (CLIWOC).[^12] Thus, like many overly hopeful
digital humanities researchers, we were stumped by the incomplete nature
of the archive. While the group did generate some useful visualizations
of mortality in the Middle Passage, the large-scale project proved too
daunting, primarily because of the absence of individuated data about
mortality and ships' routes.

While faced with the pragmatic difficulty of representing mortality in
the digital archive as it is currently structured, we confronted the
simultaneous moral and ethical questions surrounding the use of scale as
a primary method of storytelling. Indeed, while initiatives such as the
*Slave Voyages Database* and "The Atlantic Slave Trade in Two Minutes"
ably convey the awful scope of the transatlantic slave trade, they run
the risk of assimilating what was in actuality 12 million individual
human beings' personal tragedies into a single dataset of a single
tragedy of human history. In a recent article, Johnson argues that such
projects run the risk of dehumanizing Black people and thingifying their
bodies in ways that are not only complicit with the historical
injustices of slavery but also the present-day manifestations of that
legacy.[^13] Vincent Brown likens the statistical analysis of
slave-trade mortality rates to the chalk outline of a murder victim,
arguing that "\[t\]he data delineate scale, proportion, and distribution
quite well, but they cannot represent the wrenching personal trials
endured by the enslaved."[^14] Johnson's and Brown's arguments here
coincide with a broader concern about the violence of the slave trade
archive towards the subjecthood of the enslaved, as expressed by
scholars and writers such as Saidiya Hartman, M. NourbeSe Philip, Britt
Rusert, and others cited in our introduction.[^15] To 'short-circuit'
this violence, Johnson looks to what she calls "Black digital practice,"
or "the many ways users, content creators, coders, and programmers have
worked ethical, intentional praxis into their work in pursuit of more
just and humane productions of knowledge."[^16] In an attempt to honor
the ethos of Black digital practice, it became our challenge as digital
humanists to visually represent mortality in the Middle Passage while
resisting the "double dehumanization" of quantification unaccompanied by
human narratives. Instead, we looked for ways to reinsert individuality,
subjectivity, and humanity into the digital archive of slavery while
holding room for the impossibility of redress.[^17]

In moving away from the overdetermined conclusions and misleading sense
of completeness conveyed by large-scale visuals and datasets, we were
inspired by the methodology of critical cartography.[^18] In particular,
we were intrigued by the example of ["The Left-to-Die
Boat,"](https://forensic-architecture.org/investigation/the-left-to-die-boat)
a digital investigation of the journey and eventual sinking of a boat of
African migrants in the Mediterranean in 2011, led by Charles Heller and
Lorenzo Pezzani of the Forensic Architecture Lab at Goldsmiths
University, London. This work, prosecutorial in nature, aims to
repurpose surveillance technologies such as military and coast guard
photography as evidence of the negligence and ultimate guilt of European
governing bodies in migrant deaths. Particularly impressive is how "The
Left-to-Die Boat" achieves epistemic distance from its source data; its
use of satellite images in defamiliarizing ways shows not only how
(digital) surveillance technologies are made complicit in rendering
certain human lives expendable, but also how the human agents who wield
these technologies are responsible for their choices to leave others to
die. The researchers' decision to focus on the case study of a single
migrant voyage helps throw into sharper relief these issues of agency
and contingency, allowing the project to make visible the specific
persons implicated in the sinking of a specific vessel even as these
events are taken to be representative of larger trends of violence and
injustice. For our own work in the context of Atlantic slavery, the
"Left-to-Die Boat" prompted us to think critically about how the
cumulative mortality along the Middle Passage was the consequence of
specific persons' choices (those of company officials, ship captains,
crew members, etc.), albeit punctuated by subversive acts of captive
Africans, including suicide as form of resistance. We therefore came to
regard disaggregation as a potentially powerful tool of Black digital
practice. If we could uncover archival records regarding specific
persons on a specific slaving voyage, and if we could map this voyage as
the "Left-to-Die Boat" researchers did, might we also be able to make
room for the counterfactual possibilities and contingencies contained
within the awful statistics and overdetermined narratives of Atlantic
slavery?

## 3. Mapping a Single Voyage

Both materially constrained by existing datasets (e.g., *Slave Voyages*
and CLIWOC) and increasingly motivated on a theoretical and ethical
plane towards other types of approaches, the team attempted to locate a
single captain's or first mate's logbook. This crucial record would
contain both (a) the latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates necessary
to map a voyage, and (b) the date and time of specific deaths onboard
the ship. In other words, we turned at this point from big data to what
we might call 'small data'; from aggregated data to data as
disaggregated as possible. We felt there were advantages to such an
approach, that in doing so we were taking seriously Catherine
D'Ignazio's and Lauren Klein's call to "embrace emotion and embodiment"
in our project rather than obscuring individual bodies and their
visceral experiences through large datasets and databases.[^19] The work
of "embracing emotion and embodiment" and re-membering bodies opens up
possibilities not only to acknowledge them as once inhabited, as
possessing human subjecthood, but also to begin memorializing lives (cut
short) by recasting otherwise unmarked ocean spaces as their places of
death.[^20]

Observations about the location of a ship and any onboard deaths were
often---though, as we came to realize, not always---recorded daily in
captains' or first mates' logbooks.[^21] In October 2019, we were able
to locate the logbook of the slave ship the *Good Hope* (c. 1757). The
logbook was authored by Samuel Gould, a native of Killingly,
Connecticut, who served as first mate aboard the *Good Hope* as it
trafficked enslaved persons from Bunce Island off the coast of
present-day Sierra Leone to a lifetime of plantation slavery in St.
Kitts. Gould's logbook contains daily entries that mark the date, ship's
latitude and (dead-reckoned) longitude, as well as any deaths of
enslaved Africans on board the ship, making it the kind of primary
source that would help us punctuate aggregated mortality data with
individual stories. Select pages of the logbook, which is housed at the
Connecticut State Library, are accessible on the website of the [Museum
of Connecticut
History](https://museumofcthistory.org/log-book-of-slave-traders/).
The library staff generously supplied us with scans of the rest of the
logbook.

In order to decipher the logbook, we sought the help of Dr. James
Delgado, an archaeologist with expertise in the history of marine
navigation.[^22] We then learned how to translate the then-common method
of deductive ("dead") reckoning into contemporary mapping
geocoordinates.[^23] By sifting through the multiple entries used to
track the ship's course, we were able to locate the data necessary to
map the voyage.[^24] For example, on the page of the logbook shown in
figure 1, observations about the ship's course, including distance
traveled during the previous twenty-four hours, as well as the latitude
and longitude, are listed directly above the date. The three leftmost
columns record the hour in two-hour increments starting from noon of the
previous day and ending the following noon, as well as the ship's speed
in knots and half-knots. In the "Remarks" section furthest to the right,
Gould inserts an entry at 4:00 PM that states "fresh breezes + hazy."
Below is the kind of notation that we see on 14 separate occasions
during this part of the voyage. It reads: "at 3 am died a small boy
slave with a flux." By converting these observations and the events they
describe into mappable datapoints, we hoped to re-member or memorialize
deaths such as this one---evidence of which appears in the archive as
fleetingly and mundanely as the day's weather---while also shedding
light on the agency of captive Africans in their deaths.

%}

Working with the Center for Data Visualization Sciences at Duke
University, we were able to input this historical data into modern GIS
software and, in doing so, draw a digital and visual link between the
events of 1757 and the (present, enduring) units of ocean-space where
these events took place, marking with modern technology and in our own
time the scenes of these past atrocities. At this point, we had a
map that realized our goal of accurately locating the deaths of enslaved
people in the Middle Passage, albeit on quite a small scale. However,
the map itself, and the methods we used to produce it, generated their
own set of questions. Our chosen technology---ArcGIS---presented us with
certain limitations on how we were able to represent the records of
mortality we found in the logbook of the *Good Hope*.

In the process of translating archival data into a map, the team was
highly conscious of the imperial legacies of western cartographic
projects. Throughout the age of "Enlightenment," European colonizers
effectuated spatial expansion in parallel with the dehumanization of the
other peoples they encountered. Ways of representing and producing space
through Cartesian coordinate systems found their counterpoint in the
annihilation of myriad indigenous African and American spatial and
geographic knowledges. Not only did condensing places to coordinates
enable transatlantic navigation, territorial conquest, genocide, and
mass deportation, but the process of mapmaking also acted as a practice
by which the white cartographic subject invented itself at the expense
of indigenous knowledge producers. Tiffany King names this process as
the "cartographic writing of the human through the spatial and
orthographic negation of Native and Black people."[^25] Because of this,
it is uncertain whether maps created within the epistemological scope of
this inheritance and using the same logics (with ArcGIS) can be made to
convey oppositional spatial and geographic experiences. In other words,
should we represent atrocities with the logics that made them possible
in the first place?

Responding to this question with a tentative 'no,' geographer Matthew
Wilson, a theorist of critical cartography, suggests that "attaching
points, lines, and polygons to narrative may actually delimit the kinds
of narrative that can be advanced ... placing history onto the map may
only further distract from historical (and spatial) interpretation made
most powerful in narrative."[^26] Indeed, in our case, the transposing
of logbook entries into two-dimensional and purportedly objective
geocoordinates projects a sense of narrative linearity and certainty
that does not reflect the shifting reality of oceanic space. One of the
ways in which we attempted to suspend this sense of narrative closure
was by inverting the textures and tones on our map in order to highlight
the ocean rather than the land masses from which and to which the *Good
Hope* was bound (see figure 2). In this decision, we were particularly
inspired both by "The Left-to-Die Boat" and the work of Jennifer Reed,
who, in a recent article, reflects at length on the "associative and
emotional" significance of color in mapping acts of sexual violence on
the estate of enslaver Thomas Thistlewood.[^27] However, while visually
emphasizing the ocean helped us convey a sense of existential
uncertainty on our map, we still struggled to account for the
experiential or transformative element of the Middle Passage, or what
Sowandé M. Mustakeem calls the "human manufacturing process" of the
transatlantic slave trade.[^28] That is to say, we wanted to avoid the
empiricist trap that comes from the certainty of mapping while
simultaneously acknowledging the atrocities that transpired on the *Good Hope*. In one sense, we need
technologies such as GIS in order to make the ship's voyage visible, but
in another, as critical humanists, it behooves us to trouble and add
dimensionality to the dots and lines of the journey.

## 4. Critical Fabulation and the Digital

Our experiments with GIS technology speak to a range of debates in the
digital humanities about the role of DH in the scholarly process.
Resisting the tendency to define digital projects in terms of their
professionally recognized and often institutionally rewarded outcomes or
deliverables (e.g., the digital map, database, exhibit, etc.), the
authors of "The Digital Humanities Manifesto 2.0" embrace a vision of
the digital humanities as invested in process rather than in product:
"\[a\]nything that stands in the way of the perpetual mash‐up and
remix," they write, "stands in the way of the digital revolution ...
Untapped gold mines of knowledge are to be found in the realm of
*process*."[^29] Later, they contend that "the phrase \[digital
humanities\] has use‐value to the degree that it can serve as an
umbrella under which to group both people and projects seeking to
reshape and reinvigorate contemporary arts and humanities practices, and
expand their boundaries."[^30] What these comments suggest is that, when
practiced intentionally, DH is but one step in the scholarly process or
instrument in the scholarly toolkit, one which can broaden the
interpretive horizon of the professional humanities, but which cannot
(or at least need not) furnish ready-made interpretations and insights
by itself.

This instrumental vision of the digital humanities has particular import
in the field of digital work on slavery, where scholars such as Britt
Rusert and Jessica Marie Johnson have expressed concern about the
fetishization of the digital among their peers. Rusert warns that
"digitization does not necessarily enable more access to the
perspectives and stories of the enslaved ... \[e\]ven collections that
make available runaway slave notices, plantation records, and other
documents of slavery add but one more layer of mediation between the
scholar/listener and slavery\'s archive, through the process of
digitization itself."[^31] While digitization and digital methods cannot
close the interpretive distance between the enslaved and the scholar of
slavery, they can, however, remediate and remix the archive in ways that
expose this distance and the silence it produces, prompting us to
acknowledge the present absence of the perspectives and stories of the
enslaved that are beyond access. One digital project we found
particularly useful in opening up new avenues of scholarly and creative
inquiry was Vincent Brown's digital project *Slave Revolt in Jamaica,
1760--1761: A Cartographic Narrative*. In an article about this project,
Brown emphasizes that "\[m\]apping the revolt and its suppression
illustrates something that is difficult to glean from simply reading the
textual sources," viz., the role of geography in "the tactical dynamics
of slave insurrection and counterrevolt," ultimately making possible
many of the insights in his 2020 book *Tacky's Revolt: The Story of an
Atlantic Slave War*.[^32]

In our case, the work of digital mapping brought us into close contact
with an individual's death. In the previous section, we referred to an entry in the  *Good Hope* logbook that describes the death of a "small boy" who "at 3 am died
... with a flux" fourteen days into the journey of the *Good Hope*. This
entry initially captured our attention because it was one of the few
recorded deaths in the logbook that had a modifier, "small," before the
standard "boy," "man," "girl," descriptors. Indeed, to engage with the
logbook of the *Good Hope* is in large part to foreground the voice of
an enslaver, viz., Samuel Gould, whose perspective typifies the
empirical hubris of European colonizers in their quest to capture and
quantify space, time, and human beings. To generate a map from Gould's
geocoordinates then is to take his epistemological points of departure
as our own; mapping this entry comes close to being an act of mere
transposition. In looking for ways to move beyond the impasse of simply
visualizing enslavers' worldviews, we were moved by Gould's decision to
characterize the small boy as "small." Gould likely included this
modifier for economic reasons: small might have denoted the boy as a
*smaller* fraction of a commodity, marking him as less valuable.
However, for us, the fact of the boy's being "small" provided an opening
to glimpse the lives, experiences, and knowledges of the people fixed as
commodities by Gould's record-keeping and wider epistemological
violence. We wrestled with what this specificity meant. How "small" was
this "small boy"? How old was he? Was he "small" simply because he was
young, or for another reason? How might his "smallness" have shaped or
otherwise contributed to his death?

Gould's geocoordinates enabled us to locate the site of the small boy's
death, or, more specifically, his resting place at sea, and to know the
apparent medical circumstances of his death. Seeing a GIS rendering of
Gould's notation made the event he casually describes feel more tangible
to us, putting us into closer contact with the small boy's life through
the place of his death. But, as humanists, we wanted to know more: What
was his name? Who was his mother? When he fell ill, did anyone care for
him, physically or emotionally? Was he alone when he died in the early
hours of the morning? How did he experience the suspended time and space
of the slave ship? The written archive, populated by the notations of
men like Gould, cannot answer these questions. Even digital mediations
involving archival objects like the logbook of the *Good Hope* cannot
put sufficient distance between enslavers' observations and the violence
done to people like the small boy.

To better achieve this distance, we turned to the methodology of critical fabulation, as practiced and theorized by Saidiya Hartman. In her conceptualization of the
methodology, Hartman draws from the following descriptions of fabula:
"denotes the basic elements of story, the building blocks of the
narrative ... \[a\] series of logically and chronologically related
events that are caused and experienced by actors."[^33] While not
exactly fiction, critical fabulation is a way of producing knowledge
that exists at the "intersection of the fictive and the historical" and,
according to Stephanie Smallwood, whose 2007 book *Saltwater Slavery*
incorporates the subjunctive mood called for by Hartman to powerful
effect, illuminates "the false dichotomies of truth vs. fiction and fact
vs. fantasy."[^34] While critical fabulation may escape the restrictions
of traditional historiography, questions---both ethical and
methodological---still arise. For instance, one must take care not to
use narrative to "fulfill our yearning for romance, our desire to hear
the subaltern speak, or our search for the subaltern as heroic actor
whose agency triumphs over the forces of oppression."[^35] To critically
fabulate, or to think and work in the subjunctive, is to sit with the
discomfort of trying to achieve the "impossible goal" of redress.[^36]

The small boy who died on May 11, 1757 died after three weeks at sea on
the *Good Hope*. Our critical fabulation of the circumstances of the
small boy's death is [published on our
website](http://rememberingthemiddlepassage.com/#small_boy)
and weaves together (retro-)speculative accounts of the boy's childhood,
family, illness, and burial. For us, the radical
individuation of critical fabulation provided a counterhistory to the
dehumanizing drive of slavery's archive, restoring the kinship and
tribal connections of the dead and reminding us of the funerary
principles of which he was deprived. But we found that disaggregating
the death of this one small boy from the many like him who died on the
Middle Passage, even the several "small boys" and girls who died on the
1757 voyage of the *Good Hope*, came at its own cost. Indeed, it tends
to obscure the fact that complete disaggregation is impossible. Small
Boy can never be just one small boy who died of flux during his Middle
Passage journey. Like Hartman's Venus, he will always carry the
"immeasurable weight of black lives made barely knowable by the violence
of racial slavery."[^37] Our speculation of what he could have
experienced on the *Good Hope*, his potential kinship networks, and the
mourning practices of his people mostly come from collective historical
information regarding enslaved West Africans. In other words, critical
fabulation runs the risk of spectacularizing the historical subjects
whose stories it seeks to tell, making historical individuals, e.g., the
archetypes of "small boy" and "Venus," stand in for broader collectives
of enslaved Africans.

Yet, we contend that bringing critical fabulation into the digital
archive and into conversation with digital humanities methodologies,
specifically those informed by Black digital practice, can help
alleviate this problem of spectacularization. In many ways, the
methodological aims of both critical fabulation and Black digital
practice are commensurate. According to Hartman, critical fabulation
responds to the problem that the lives of the enslaved are "entangled
with and impossible to differentiate from the terrible utterances that
condemned them to death."[^38] (In the case of the *Good Hope* logbook,
Gould's description of the "small boy" marks its referent as "degraded
matter, dishonored life.") Like critical fabulation, Black digital
practice seeks to reconfigure enslavers' language and turn it---fabulate
it---into something new and more humanistic.

However, where Hartman's model of critical fabulation and our deployment
of it arguably differ is in the kinds of primary sources with which they
engage. In texts such as *Lose Your Mother* and "Venus in Two Acts,"
Hartman draws upon a primarily prose-based and printed archive; as she
points out, "the lives of two girls \[whose stories she critically
fabulates\] are recorded in the *official* annals of British law and
parliamentary debate."[^39] (We emphasize the descriptor "official" here
because it registers the public and publicized nature of Hartman's
comparatively 'analog' archive).[^40] By contrast, in our own experiment
with deploying critical fabulation in the digital realm, the kinds of
records that interested us were primarily numerical---*digital* in the
broad and original sense of the term---and handwritten. As critical
fabulators, therefore, we encounter and negotiate the violence of
slavery's archive differently than does Hartman. Whereas Hartman turns
to critical fabulation to cut through an excess of words spoken and
published by officials whose very verbosity obscures and does violence
to the subjectivity of enslaved persons, we turn to critical fabulation
to supplement a lack of words in the digital archive and to lend quality
to the quantities we find calculated therein, moving from numbers
towards narratives.

This shift from numbers to critically fabulated narrative was, in part,
made possible by a growing body of rich and meticulous historical work
comprising the field of "Middle Passage Studies." Historians of the
Middle Passage such as Marcus Rediker, Stephanie Smallwood, and Sowande'
Mustakeem share our grim fascination with "the ledgers, bills of lading,
and other instruments of accounting" that make up slavery's digital
archive.[^41] Rediker and Smallwood, for their part, seek to supplement
these digital and handwritten records with enslavers' private
correspondence in an effort to bring to the fore what they call "the
high human drama of the slave trade" (Rediker) or "the human story of
the slave trade" (Smallwood).[^42] Mustakeem, conversely, finds digital
records valuable in their own right, regarding them as "more than crude
and cold numbers" inasmuch as they are accompanied by handwritten notes
that "enable a more textured description of slaves' bodies" and furnish
insights into "the tangible effects of slavery at sea."[^43] What
distinguishes our own engagement with these kinds of digital sources
from the work of these historians is precisely our decision to
prioritize an individual human's life story over the more general "human
story of the slave trade." The entry in Gould's logbook in which we
encounter the small boy might have provided evidence for a historian
like Mustakeem for a broad historical claim about, e.g., the prevalence
of flux among enslaved children onboard slave ships; but we hope to
explore how focusing on the details of the small boy's death, rather
than treating him as one example among many, deepens our understanding
of the Middle Passage---and we turned to the methodology of critical
fabulation to make this narrative maneuver possible. We acknowledge,
however, that this turn would not be possible without the extraordinary
scholarship of Smallwood, Mustakeem, and others.

At the root of our experiments with critical fabulation, and our efforts
to lend narrative quality to the numerical records of slavery's digital
archive, was the fraught mapping process discussed in the previous
section. Katherine McKittrick maintains that the "\[i\]interplay between
narrative and material worlds is especially useful in black studies,
because our analytical sites, and our selfhood, are often reduced to
metaphor, analogy, trope, and symbol."[^44] By returning to and
re-presenting the material world that was once the scene of the small
boy's death, we opened the way for a narrative to surface. Our practice
of critical fabulation grew out of the counter-abstraction work made
possible by digital methods and allowed us to depart from somewhere
other than the mere seven words left by an enslaver. The act of plotting
the coordinates accompanying Gould's "terrible utterance" distilled vast
ocean-space into the material site of the small boy's last moments. If,
as McKittrick argues, "\[t\]he dead spaces are inextricably linked to
the dehumanizing scripts,"[^45] then reinvesting "dead"-reckoned and
empty ocean-space with significance as a human resting place helps us to
resist reducing a human life to a spectacular symbol or to a dehumanized
datapoint.

In "Venus in Two Acts," Hartman makes her readers bear witness to the
acts that transpired on the deck of a slave ship, the *Recovery* (1791),
reconfiguring the legal testimony given by its captain in the course of
legal proceedings against him. Whereas Hartman's narrative rests on the
liminal deck of the slave ship, our own digital work uses geospatial
data to precisely situate a different slave ship in the ocean space,
including the persons held captive in its hold. Visualizing this
otherwise unmarked space, and anchoring it in specific coordinates,
provided us with an basis upon which to critically fabulate
the narrative of a death that, in its mundaneness, does not appear in
the printed archive (e.g., in legal records, newspaper reports, etc.) as
Venus's does. Unlike Venus, the small boy was not identified as a victim
in a murder trial; his death, like those of countless others, was the
consequence of an illness that, while endemic, was not unavoidable, and
for which his enslavers bore responsibility. Mapping the site of the small boy's death reveals the site where
a historical injustice occurred. Locating and visualizing this site
renders more proximate the conditions that caused the small boy's
premature death and therefore provides a material point of departure for
creative reckonings with his life lived and life lost.

## 5. Conclusion: Towards (Digital) Community

For our research collective, the combination of critical fabulation and
digital methods proved a compelling way to take up the mantle of Black
digital practice, "chart\[ing\] a path against the drive for data" and
expanding on the unquantifiable.[^46] Imagining in a subjunctive mood
the life story of the small boy referenced in Gould's logbook entry
enabled an epistemic shift towards the "more just and humane productions
of knowledge" that Johnson calls for.[^47] We have argued that critical
fabulation is a powerful response to the absented presences held within
the clean lines of digital mapping, and contended that spatializing
slavery's archive with digital tools affords new ways to expand on
critical fabulation, providing a numerical rather than prose-based
grounding. The reciprocal interplay of these techniques in our project,
we hope, works to "resist and counteract slavery's dehumanizing
impulses."[^48]

However, just as it was not enough for us to simply map sites of death
along a slaving voyage without further interpretation, it is arguably
not enough for our digital project, including the narrative of the small
boy, to exist solely as an academic digital humanities project whose
users and critics are primarily scholars and students at elite
institutions. Indeed, as it is currently structured and published, our
project falls short of many of the ideals that Johnson envisages for
Black digital practice, especially in its more radical aims---for
example: broad and democratic community engagement, amplifying the
voices of descendants of the enslaved; subversion of elite and narrowly
academic forms of digital literacy and knowledge production; and,
allyship with Black activism and revolutionary projects. Ultimately, we
maintain that this project was an experiment in how digital methods can
disrupt colonial productions of space and challenge the disposability of
Black life; but we do not claim that our methods are the only (or even a
sufficient) way to achieve this objective or that they have some claim
to legitimacy over other Black digital praxes.

One of the core claims of this article has been that, in order to
re-center the human amid the mass of Middle Passage mortality data, we
must first disaggregate datapoints that otherwise remain obscured in
aggregates of body counts, total voyage numbers, etc. That being said,
we harbor concerns about how the work of disaggregation, e.g., singling
out the life story of one particular individual among the mass of
individuals who died along the Middle Passage, could be seen as a
methodological maneuver undergirded by Western imperial and liberal
values that privilege individual over communal experience. In
disaggregating the small boy's death from the overwhelming data of the
archive, it is important that we nonetheless hold room for the
collectives of family, community, and diaspora to which he belonged, as
well as the spiritual communion that he may have found in death. This
includes his relations and kinsfolk among the present-day descendants of
enslaved Africans to whom, we, as researchers of Atlantic slavery whose
own racial positionalities vary, are first and foremost responsible.

While, as the foregoing analysis bears out, we follow Audre Lorde in our
skepticism about the degree to which the master's tools can dismantle
the master's house, we remain committed to and encouraged by the
participatory possibilities of the digital as a platform for research
and conversations about the histories and legacies of slavery. Our own
work is published on an open-access website. And, in January 2021, we
hosted a virtual conference inspired by our project in which
talks from historian Jessica Marie Johnson, economist William A. Darity
Jr., folklorist A. Kirsten Mullen, and community activist Pierce Freelon
addressed an audience of nearly two hundred geographically disparate and
professionally diverse stakeholders, and community members on how
commemoration can lead to material and impactful change for the
descendants of slavery. At its best, the digital can be a powerful force
of collaboration, making possible new and more humane kinds of
aggregations---alliances, collectives, communities, coalitions,
etc.---and it is in this spirit that we share with the readers of
*archipelagos* these reflections on our own digital experiments with
representing Middle Passage mortality.

    the dead to measure the toll the voyage took on African life, we
    have made that body count the most potent symbolic measure of the
    horrors of the middle passage ... overall numbers---and our
    interpretation of them---correspond only loosely to the ways African
    captives experienced and understood shipboard mortality." See
    Smallwood, *Saltwater Slavery,* p. 137.

[^11]: From eighteenth-century abolitionism through to the development
    of international human rights law and the modern-day reparations
    movement, there is a long tradition of classifying slavery and slave
    trafficking as a "crime against humanity." See, e.g., Ariela Gross,
    "'A Crime Against Humanity': Slavery and The Boundaries of Legality,
    Past and Present," *Law and History Review* 35, no. 1 (2017), pp.
    1-8.

[^12]: We initially set out to combine the *Slave Voyages* and CLIWOC
    databases in order to find an overlapping subset of voyages for
    which there was both information about their exact routes and
    records of their involvement in the slave trade. Our hope was to
    find an area in the Atlantic where a great number of deaths had
    occurred. Andrew Sluyter has done a similar project with twenty-six
    Dutch slaving voyages, but we hoped to produce results on a larger
    scale. In order to make sense of this large archive, we
    cross-referenced ships' names and dates of departure in the *Slave
    Voyages Database* with CLIWOC to produce a map of nine
    journeys. Mapping these journeys revealed that many of the ships in
    CLIWOC were not slaving vessels and that the names of these ships
    were often reused.

[^21]: For instance, in one of the team's first research trips, team
    member Jane Harwell found that the logbook of the slave ship
    *Marlborough* (c. 1750) contained neither observations about
    location nor about mortality.

    *Clotilda*, the last known slave ship to land in the United States.

    accessed 29 August 2022.

[^23]: In the logbook of the *Good Hope*, latitudinal and longitudinal
    coordinates are given in the format of degrees minutes seconds
    (DMS), with the small issue that seconds are not listed, but the
    crucial information of degrees and minutes is captured. This made
    determining the actual position of the *Good Hope* at any given
    point of time uncertain but not impossible. For example, one of the
    entries on Saturday, 30 April 1757, had the boat at 9 28 N, 16 1 W
    or 9 Degrees 28 Minutes North 16 Degrees 1 Minute West. In order to
    map these coordinates using modern mapping software, we needed to
    convert the DMS coordinates into decimal degrees. For the purposes
    of our project, we estimated seconds as zero.

[^24]: It is worth reflecting on how these changing methods of mapping
    the ocean and measuring movement across it inflect our understanding
    of those who, like the small boy, disappeared below its surface. In
    *The Social Construction of the Ocean*, Philip Steinberg notes that,
    "\[b\]y the early seventeenth century, maps featuring sea monsters
    representing marine nature and ships representing the social
    activity that transpired in the area of ocean-space began to be
    replaced by maps portraying a grid over an essentially featureless
    ocean." This focus on the surface as the "known" aspect of the ocean
    had the effect of rendering the oceanic depths the complementary
    "unknown." By ejecting the bodies of the enslaved from the realm of
    the known and the measurable, enslavers may have hoped to erase them
    entirely. On the contrary, as Katherine McKittrick and Clyde Woods
    argue, "\[t\]he storm-torn bodies, those thrown overboard and
    forgotten, and the many other narratives and experiences that are
    violently and/or uncomfortably situated with the geography of reason
    have produced what Edouard Glissant calls submarine roots: a network
    of branches, cultures, and relations that position black geographies
    and the oceanic history of diaspora as integral to and entwining
    with---rather than outside---what has been called coloniality's
    persistence." See Philip E. Steinberg, *The Social Construction of
    the Ocean* (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2001), p. 105;

    Norton, 2019), pp. 2-3. That Harman broadens her archive in her

    monograph is concerned.
