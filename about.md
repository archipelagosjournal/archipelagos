The transformation of the academy by the digital dispensation presents
challenges to customary ways of learning, teaching, conducting research,
interpreting documents, and presenting findings. It also offers immense
opportunities in each of these areas. New media enable oration,
graphics, objects, and even embodied performance to supplement existing
forms of scholarly production as well as to constitute entirely original
platforms. Opportunities for interdisciplinary collaboration have
expanded enormously, information has been made more accessible, and
research made more efficient on multiple levels. We scholars are called
upon now, with some urgency, to adapt our investigative and pedagogical
methods to an academic climate deluged by a superabundance of
information and analysis. This has created opportunities for open-ended
and multiform engagements, interactive and continually updating
archives, databases, cartographic applications that enrich the
geographic imagination with historical information, and online dialogues
with our colleagues and the wider public.

The need for such engagements is especially immediate among the people
of the Caribbean and its diasporas. Information technology has become an
increasingly significant part of the way that those in the region frame
pressing social problems and political aspirations. Aesthetic media like
photography and painting—because they are relatively inexpensive and do
not rely necessarily on formal training—have become popular among
economically dispossessed and politically marginalized constituencies.
Moreover, the Internet is analogous in important ways to the Caribbean
itself as a dynamic and fluid cultural space: it is generated from
disparate places and by disparate peoples; it challenges fundamentally
the geographical and physical barriers that disrupt or disallow
connection; and it places others and elsewheres in relentless relation.
Yet while we celebrate these opportunities for connectedness, we also
must make certain that our work in the digital realm undermines and
confronts rather than re-inscribes forms of silencing and exclusion in
the Caribbean.

Our own impetus for creating a new platform arises from this continued
need to raise the voices of those working to understand the impact of
technology on our scholarly and cultural pursuits. At this very hybrid
moment, caught between the analog and the electronic, systems of
production, validation, and distribution of our scholarly and cultural
work have reified to benefit large monopolies—indexers, database
brokers, software vendors—whose ultimate motive is profit. In order to
keep these large economic sectors thriving, access has been regimented.
As Caribbean scholars, we find ourselves in the double-bind of a new
master's house, both infrastructurally and historically. Stewards of an
archive that cannot be disentangled from The Archive housed at major
global institutions—whose mechanical image lies outside our control—and
of our fragile, opaque archives in their saltpetered warehouses at the
margins, we have committed to join those who are active in the design of our
future memory.

We have thought through our platform with the same critical eye we cast on the archive, and our resulting infrastructure embodies our principles. We are fully open access and charge no author fees. Our authors retain their copyright. We pursue best indexing, accessibility, and archival practices. We emphasize the primacy of "[sustainable authorship in plain text](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/sustainable-authorship-in-plain-text-using-pandoc-and-markdown)." Our website and PDFs are generated from the same markdown files using Jekyll and ConTeXt, respectively. The resulting website is light-weight and mobile-friendly, acknowledging the importance of mobile phones, bandwidth differentials, and data costs in the Caribbean. We version and share our software and data freely on [GitHub](https://github.com/sx-archipelagos/sxa). We have reduced the workflow for producing a journal to a small team and a small budget, and we offer our production knowledge to those who would ask for it.

As the academy increasingly embraces the "digital turn," we ask the
following: How might we, as editors, publishers, and ourselves
Caribbeanist scholars, encourage and facilitate our colleagues’
investment in the production and dissemination of the knowledge they
generate? How will we go about cultivating both producers and reviewers
of quality digital scholarship, and how will we help to ensure that this
scholarship is recognized and rewarded by the profession? How might we
encourage collaboration with, increase accessibility for, and otherwise
work to narrow the gap between Caribbeanist researchers, especially
those in the North Atlantic academy, and the communities we are
committed to serving?

To answer these and other urgent questions, we need in this moment to
engage two critical functions: to understand and to build. For us, these
functions do not follow one from the other, but rather operate in tandem. As
we build and understand, we do so illuminated by first light of the
long arc of Caribbean remembrance, from Maroon communities to the recent
collaborative efforts to build a [Digital Library of the
Caribbean](http://www.dloc.com/). We do so remaining ever vigilant to
materialist, ecological, identitarian, and liberatory considerations. We
do so, in the last instance, fully conscious of our decades-old
wrangling of computers—from Kamau Brathwaite's *Sycorax* to the
ingenious scholar-hackers of today's Havana or the model work of [Create Caribbean](http://createcaribbean.org/create/) in Dominica. Our cutting edge comes,
then, not from a misguided sense of techno-utopianism—or worse,
techno-determinism—but as a new small axe, hacking away still at that
master's house.
